<small>DIVERSE WAYS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> people were together in a very
pleasant little parlor, in a land where the sun
shines nearly all the time. They were Doctor
Mack, whose long, full name was Alexander
MacDonald; mamma, who was Mrs. John
Smith; and Josephine, who was Mrs. Smith&#8217;s
little girl with a pretty big name of her own.</p>

<p>Doctor Mack called Mrs. Smith &#8220;Cousin
Helen,&#8221; and was very good to her. Indeed,
ever since papa John Smith had had to go
away and leave his wife and child to house-keep
by themselves the busy doctor-cousin
had done many things for them, and mamma
was accustomed to go to him for advice about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
all little business matters. It was because she
needed his advice once more that she had summoned
him to the cottage now; even though
he was busier than ever, since he was making
ready to leave San Diego that very day for the
long voyage to the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>Evidently the advice that had so promptly
been given was not agreeable; for when
Josephine looked up from the floor where she
was dressing Rudanthy, mamma was crying
softly, and Doctor Mack was saying in his
gravest take-your-medicine-right-away kind of
a voice that there was &#8220;nothing else to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my poor darling! She is so young,
so innocent. I cannot, I cannot!&#8221; wailed the
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is the most self-reliant, independent
young lady of her age that I ever knew,&#8221; returned
the doctor.</p>

<p>Josephine realized that they were talking
about her, but didn&#8217;t see why that should make
her mother sad. It must be all the cousin-doctor&#8217;s
fault. She had never liked him since he
had come a few weeks before, and scratched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
her arm and made it sore. &#8220;Vaccinated&#8221; it,
mamma had said, to keep her from being ill
sometime. Which had been very puzzling to
the little girl, because &#8220;sometime&#8221; might never
come, while the arm-scratching had made her
miserable for the present. She now asked, in
fresh perplexity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I &#8216;poor,&#8217; mamma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At this moment I feel that you are very
poor indeed, my baby,&#8221; answered the lady.</p>

<p>Josephine glanced about the familiar room,
in which nothing seemed changed except her
mother&#8217;s face. That had suddenly grown pale
and sad, and even wrinkled, for there was a
deep, deep crease between its brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny. Where are my rags?&#8221; asked
the child.</p>

<p>Mamma smiled; but the doctor laughed outright,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is more than one way of being
poor, little missy. Come and show me your
arm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine shivered as she obeyed. However,
there was nothing to fear now, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
arm was well healed, and the gentleman patted
it approvingly, adding:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a good little girl, Josephine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Doctor Mack, I try to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you don&#8217;t love me, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not&mdash;not so&mdash;so very much,&#8221; answered
the truthful child, painfully conscious of her
own rudeness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so well as Rudanthy,&#8221; he persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing like!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Josephine,&#8221; reproved mamma; then caught
her daughter in her arms, and began to lament
over her. &#8220;My darling! my darling! How
can I part from you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before any reply could be made to this
strange question, the door-bell rang, and there
came in another of those blue-coated messenger
boys, who had been coming at intervals all that
day and yesterday. He brought a telegram
which mamma opened with trembling fingers.
When she had read it, she passed it to Doctor
Mack, who also read it; after which he folded
and returned it to the lady, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Cousin Helen, you must make your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
decision at once. The steamer starts this
afternoon. If you sail by her there&#8217;s no time
to be lost. If you go, I will delay my own
preparations to help you off.&#8221;</p>

<p>For one moment more Mrs. Smith stood
silent, pressing her hands to her throbbing
temples, and gazing at Josephine as if she
could not take her eyes from the sweet, childish
face. Then she turned toward the kind doctor
and said, quite calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Cousin Aleck, I will go.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went away quickly, and mamma rang the
bell for big Bridget, who came reluctantly, wiping
her eyes on her apron. But her mistress
was not crying now, and announced:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bridget, I am starting for Chili by this
afternoon&#8217;s steamer. Josephine is going to
Baltimore by the six o&#8217;clock overland. There
isn&#8217;t a moment to waste. Please bring the
empty trunks from the storeroom and pack
them while I attend to other matters, though I
will help you as I can. Put my clothes into
the large trunk and Josephine&#8217;s into the small
one. There, there, good soul, don&#8217;t begin to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
cry again. I need all my own will to get
through this awful day; and please make haste.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the busy hours which followed both
mamma and Bridget seemed to have forgotten
the little girl, save, now and then, to answer
her questions; and one of these was:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Chili, Bridget?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s a kind of pickle-sauce, darlin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t we got some of it in the cupboard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Slathers, my colleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chili is a country, my daughter,&#8221; corrected
mamma, looking up from the letter she was
writing so hurriedly that her pen went scratch,
scratch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it red, mamma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, little one. Don&#8217;t be botherin&#8217; the
mistress the now. Here&#8217;s Rudanthy&#8217;s best
clothes. Put &#8217;em on, and have her ready for
the start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Rudanthy going a journey, too, Bridget?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Over the seas and far away&#8217;&mdash;or over the
land; what differ?&#8221;</p>

<p>When the doll had been arrayed in its finery
mamma had finished her writing, and, rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
from her desk, called the child to her. Then
she took her on her lap and said, very earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Josephine, you are eight years old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mamma. This very last birthday that
ever was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is old enough to be brave and helpful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, quite, mamma. I didn&#8217;t cry when
Doctor Mack vaccinated me, and I sewed a
button on my apron all myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a time I am obliged to go away from
you, my&mdash;my precious!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine put up her hand and stroked her
mother&#8217;s cheek, begging:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, mamma, and please, please
don&#8217;t go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady&#8217;s answer was a question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love papa, darling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mamma! How funny to ask! Course
I do, dearly, dearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor papa is ill. Very ill, I fear. He is
alone in a far, strange country. He needs me
to take care of him. He has sent for me, and
I am going to him. But I cannot take you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
For many reasons&mdash;the climate, the uncertainty&mdash;I
am going to send you East to your
Uncle Joe&#8217;s; the uncle for whom you were
named, your father&#8217;s twin brother. Do you
understand me, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mamma. You are going to papa, and
I am going to Uncle Joe. Who is going with
me there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody, darling. There is nobody who
can go. We have no relatives here, except our
doctor-cousin, and he is too busy. So we are
going to send you by express. It is a safe
way, though a lonely one, and&mdash; Oh, my
darling, my darling; how can I! how can I!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ever since papa had gone, so long ago, Josephine
had had to comfort mamma. She did so
now, smoothing the tear-wet cheek with her
fat little hand, and chattering away about the
things Bridget had put in her trunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she mustn&#8217;t pack Rudanthy. I can&#8217;t
have her all smothered up. I will take Rudanthy
in my arms. She is so little and so
sweet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So little and so sweet!&#8221; echoed the mother&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
heart, sadly; and it was well for all that Doctor
Mack returned just then. For he was so brisk
and business-like, he had so many directions to
give, he was so cheerful and even gay, that,
despite her own forebodings, Mrs. Smith caught
something of his spirit, and completed her preparations
for departure calmly and promptly.</p>

<p>Toward nightfall it was all over: the parting
that had been so bitter to the mother and
so little understood by the child. Mamma was
standing on the deck of the outward moving
steamer, straining her eyes backward over the
blue Pacific toward the pretty harbor of San
Diego, almost believing she could still see a
little scarlet-clad figure waving a cheerful farewell
from the vanishing wharf. But Josephine,
duly ticketed and labelled, was already
curled up on the cushions of her section in the
sleeper, and staring out of window at the
sights which sped by.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same old ocean, but so big, so big!
Mamma says it is peacock-blue, like the
wadded kimono she bought at the Japanese
store. Isn&#8217;t it queer that the world should fly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
past us like this! That&#8217;s what it means in the
jogaphy about the earth turning round, I suppose.
If it doesn&#8217;t stop pretty soon I shall get
dreadful dizzy and, maybe, go to sleep. But
how could I? I&#8217;m an express parcel now.
Cousin-Doctor Mack said so, and dear mamma.
Parcels don&#8217;t go to sleep ever, do they, Rudanthy?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Rudanthy herself, lying flat in her mistress&#8217;
lap, had closed her own waxen lids and
made no answer. The only one she could
have made, indeed, would have been &#8220;Papa,&#8221;
or &#8220;Mamma,&#8221; and that wouldn&#8217;t have been a
&#8220;truly&#8221; answer, anyway.</p>

<p>Besides, just then a big man, shining with
brass buttons and a brass-banded cap, came
along and demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tickets, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine clutched Rudanthy and woke that
indolent creature rather suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolly, dolly, sit up! The shiny-blue man
is hollering at the people dreadful loud. Maybe
it&#8217;s wrong for dolls to go to sleep in these
railway things.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;WHERE&#8217;S YOUR FOLKS?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>The shiny-blue man stopped right at Josephine&#8217;s
seat, and demanded fiercely, or it
sounded fierce to the little girl:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sissy, where&#8217;s your folks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, I haven&#8217;t got any,&#8221; she answered
politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do you belong to, then?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Mrs. John Smith&#8217;s little girl, Josephine,&#8221;
she explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm. Well, where&#8217;s Mrs. John Smith?&#8221;
he persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone away,&#8221; said she, wishing he,
too, would go away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed. Tell me where to find her. You&#8217;re
small enough, but there should be somebody
else in this section.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you can&#8217;t find her. She&#8217;s sailing
and sailing on a steamer to my papa, who&#8217;s
sick and needs her more &#8217;n I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! this is odd!&#8221; said the conductor,
and passed on. But not before he added the
caution:</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay right exactly where you are,
sissy, till I come back. I&#8217;ll find out your
party and have you looked after.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>Josephine tried to obey to the very letter.
She did not even lay aside the doll she had
clasped to her breast, nor turn her head to look
out of the window. The enchanting, fairy-like
landscape might fly by and by her in its bewildering
way; she dared gaze upon it no more.</p>

<p>After a while there were lights in the coach,
and these made Josephine&#8217;s eyes blink faster
and faster. They blinked so fast, in fact, that
she never knew when they ceased doing so, or
anything that went on about her, till she felt
herself lifted in somebody&#8217;s arms, and raised
her heavy lids, to see the shiny-blue man&#8217;s
face close above her own, and to hear his voice
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little kid! Make her berth up with
double blankets, Bob, and keep an eye on it
through the night. My! Think of a baby like
this making a three-thousand-mile journey
alone. My own little ones&mdash;Pshaw! What
made me remember them just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Josephine felt a scratchy mustache
upon her check, and a hard thing which might
have been a brass button jam itself into her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
temple. Next she was put down into the softest
little bed in the world, the wheels went to
singing &#8220;Chug-chug-chug,&#8221; in the drowsiest
sort of lullaby, and that was all she knew for a
long time.</p>

<p>But something roused her, suddenly, and
she stretched out her hand to clasp, yet failed
to find, her own familiar bed-fellow. Missing
this she sat up in her berth and shrieked
aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rudanthy! Ru-dan-thy! RUDANTHY!&#8221;</p>

<small>A HUMAN EXPRESS PARCEL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Hush,</span> sissy! Don&#8217;t make such a noise.
You&#8217;re disturbing a whole car full of people,&#8221;
said somebody near her.</p>

<p>Josephine suppressed her cries, but could
not stifle the mighty sob which shook her. She
looked up into the face of the black porter,
Bob, studied it attentively, found it not unkind,
and regained her self-possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is not sissy. It&#8217;s Josephine
Smith. I want my dolly. I cannot go to
sleep without her. Her name is Rudanthy.
Fetch me Rudanthy, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was the most familiar object she had yet
seen. He might have come from the big hotel
where she and mamma had taken their meals.
Her mother&#8217;s cottage had been close by, and
sometimes of a morning a waiter had brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
their breakfast across to them. That waiter
was a favorite, and in this dimness she fancied
he had appeared before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you live at the &#8216;Florence,&#8217; boy?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, missy, but my brother does,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Fetch me Rudanthy, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>After much rummaging, and some annoyance
to a lady who now occupied the upper berth,
the doll was found and restored. But by this
time Josephine was wide awake and disposed
to ask questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all the curtains hung in a row for,
Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To hide the berths, missy. I guess you&#8217;d
better not talk now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t. What you doing now, Bob?&#8221;
she continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Making up the section across from yours,
missy. Best go to sleep,&#8221; advised the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not a bit sleepy. Are you?&#8221; was
her next demand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Umm,&#8221; came the unsatisfactory response.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;What you say? You mustn&#8217;t mumble.
Mamma never allows me to mumble. I always
speak outright,&#8221; was Josephine&#8217;s next comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon that&#8217;s true enough,&#8221; murmured the
porter, under his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Bob? I didn&#8217;t hear,&#8221; from the little
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter, I&#8217;ll tell you in the morning,&#8221;
he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather know now.&#8221;</p>

<p>No response coming to this, she went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob! Please to mind me, boy. I&mdash;want&mdash;to&mdash;hear&mdash;now,&#8221;
very distinctly and
emphatically. Josephine had been accustomed
to having her wishes attended to immediately.
That was about all mamma and big Bridget
seemed to live for.</p>

<p>The lady in the berth above leaned over the
edge and said, in a shrill whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Little girl, keep still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob finished the opposite section, and a
woman in a red kimono came from the dressing-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
and slipped behind the curtain. Josephine
knew a red kimono. It belonged to Mrs.
Dutton, the minister&#8217;s wife, and Mrs. Dutton
often stayed at mamma&#8217;s cottage. Could this
be Mrs. Dutton?</p>

<p>The child was out of bed, across the narrow
aisle, swaying with the motion of the car, pulling
the curtains apart, and clutching wildly at
a figure in the lower berth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Dutton. Oh! Mrs. Dutton! Here&#8217;s
Josephine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Ouch! Eh! What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! &#8217;Xcuse me. I thought you were
Mrs. Dutton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not. Go away. Draw that
curtain again. Go back to your folks. Your
mother should know better than to let you roam
about the sleeper at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother knows&mdash;everything!&#8221; said
Josephine, loyally. &#8220;I&#8217;m dreadful sorry
you&#8217;re not Mrs. Dutton, &#8217;cause she&#8217;d have
tooken off my coat and things. My coat is
new. My mamma wouldn&#8217;t like me to sleep
in it. But the buttons stick. I can&#8217;t undo it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;Go to your mother, child. I don&#8217;t wish to
be annoyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, &#8217;cause she&#8217;s over seas, big Bridget
says, to that red-pickle country. I s&#8217;pose I&#8217;ll
have to, then. Good-night. I hope you&#8217;ll
rest well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady in the red kimono did not feel as if
she would. She was always nervous in a
sleeping-car, anyway; and what did the child
mean by &#8220;over seas in the red-pickle country&#8221;?
Was it possible she was travelling alone?
Were there people in the world so foolish as
to allow such a thing?</p>

<p>After a few moments of much thinking, the
lady rose, carefully adjusted her kimono, and
stepped to Josephine&#8217;s berth. The child lay
holding the curtains apart, much to the disgust
of the person overhead, and gazing at the lamp
above. Her cheeks were wet, her free hand
clutched Rudanthy, and the expression of her
face was one that no woman could see and not
pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear little girl, don&#8217;t cry. I&#8217;ve come
to take off your cloak. Please sit up a minute.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s nice! Thank you. I&mdash;I&mdash;if
mamma&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to do what mamma would. There.
It&#8217;s unfastened. Such a pretty coat it is, too.
Haven&#8217;t you a little gown of some sort to put
on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All my things are in the satchel. Big
Bridget put them there. She told me&mdash;I forget
what she did tell me. Bob tucked the
satchel away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the upper berth lady was again
looking over its edge and airing her views on
the subject:</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea! If I&#8217;d known I was going to be
pushed off up here and that chit of a child put
in below I&#8217;d have made a row.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you,&#8221; said Red Kimono, calmly.
&#8220;Yet I suppose this lower bed must have been
taken and paid for in the little one&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Xcuse me, Mrs. Kimono. I&#8217;m not a little
one. I&#8217;m quite, quite big. I&#8217;m Josephine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is there nobody on this train belonging
to you, Miss Josie?&#8221; asked Mrs. Red Kimono.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;Josephine. My mamma doesn&#8217;t like nicknames.
There&#8217;s nobody but the expressman.
And everybody. Doctor Mack said to my
mamma that everybody would take care of me.
I heard him. It is the truth. Doctor Mack is
a grown-up gentleman. Gentlemen never tell
wrong stories. Do they?&#8221; asked the little
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;They ought not, surely. And we ought
not to be talking now. It is in the middle of
the night, and all the tired people want to sleep.
Are you comfortable? Then curl down here
with Rudanthy and shut your eyes. If you
happen to wake again, and feel lonely, just
come across to my berth and creep in with me.
There&#8217;s room in it for two when one of the two
is so small. Good-night. I&#8217;ll see you in the
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red Kimono ceased whispering, pressed a
kiss on the round cheek, and disappeared.
She was also travelling alone, but felt not half
so lonely since she had comforted the little
child, who was again asleep, but smiling this
time, and who awoke only when a lady in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
plain gray costume pulled the curtains apart
and touched her lightly on the shoulder. This
was &#8220;Red Kimono&#8221; in her day attire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time to get up, Josephine. Breakfast is
ready and your section-mate will want the
place fixed up. May I take you to the dressing-room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our colleen&#8217;s one of them good-natured
kind that wakes up wide to-once and laughin&#8217;,&#8221;
had been big Bridget&#8217;s boast even when her
charge was but an infant, nor had the little girl
outgrown her very sensible babyish custom.
She responded to the stranger&#8217;s greeting with
a merry smile and &#8220;Good morning!&#8221; and was
instantly ready for whatever was to come.</p>

<p>She was full of wonder over the cramped
little apartment which all the women travellers
used in succession as a lavatory, and it may be
that this wonder made her submit without hindrance
to the rather clumsy brushing of her
curls which Red Kimono attempted.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Xcuse me, that isn&#8217;t the way mamma or
big Bridget does. They put me in the bath,
first off; then my hair, and then my clothes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Haven&#8217;t you got any little girls to your
house, Red Kimono?&#8221; inquired the young
traveller.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear, I haven&#8217;t even a house;&#8221;
answered the lady, rather sadly. &#8220;But your
own dear mamma would have to forego the
bath on a railway sleeper, so let&#8217;s make haste
and give the other people their rightful use of
this place.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time several women had collected in
the narrow passage leading to the dressing-room,
and were watching through the crack of
its door till Josephine&#8217;s toilet should be completed
and their own chance could come.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes all them folks out there look
so cross, dear Red Kimono?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Selfishness, dearie. And hunger. First
come best fed, on a railway dining-car, I fancy.
There. You look quite fresh and nice. Let
us go at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they passed down the aisle where Bob
was swiftly and deftly making the sections
ready for the day&#8217;s occupancy, Josephine was
inclined to pause and watch him, but was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
hurried onward by her new friend, who
advised:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t loiter, Josephine. If we don&#8217;t get
to table promptly we&#8217;ll miss our seats. Hurry,
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you one of the selfish-hungry ones, Mrs.
Red Kimono?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady flushed, and was about to make an
indignant reply, but reflected that indignation
would be wasted on such a little person as
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be that I am, child. Certainly I am
hungry, and so should you be. I don&#8217;t remember
seeing you at supper last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had my supper with Doctor Mack before
we started. Oh, he was nice to me that time.
He gave me turkey and mince-pie, and&mdash;and
everything that was on the bill of fare that I
wanted, so&#8217;s I wouldn&#8217;t cry. He said I&#8217;d be
sick, but he didn&#8217;t mind that so long as I
didn&#8217;t cry. He hates crying people, Doctor
Mack does. He likes mamma &#8217;cause she&#8217;s so
brave. Once my papa was a soldier, and he&#8217;s
a Company F man now; but most he&#8217;s a &#8217;lectrickeller,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
and has to go away to the funny
pickle place to earn the money for mamma and
me. So then she and me never cry once. We
just keep on laughing like we didn&#8217;t mind,
even if we do hate to say good-by to papa for
so long a while. I said I wouldn&#8217;t cry, not on
all this car ride; never, not at all. I&mdash;maybe
I forgot, though. Did I cry last night, Mrs.
Red Kimono?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly, just a little; not worth mentioning.
Here, dear, climb into this chair,&#8221; was
the lady&#8217;s hasty reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a cute table! Just like hotel ones,
only littler. It&#8217;s dreadful wobbly, though. It
makes my head feel funny. I&mdash;oh! I&#8217;m&mdash;I
guess&mdash;I&#8217;m sick!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady shivered quite as visibly as poor
Josephine. The dining-car was the last one of
the long train, and swayed from side to side in
a very unpleasant manner. The motion did
not improve anybody&#8217;s appetite, and the
grown-up traveller was now vexed with herself
for befriending the childish one.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was nothing to me. Why should I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
break over my fixed rules of looking out for
number one and minding my own business?
Well, I&#8217;ll get through this meal somehow, and
then rid my hands of the matter. I&#8217;m not the
only woman in our car. Let some of the others
take a chance. The idea! sending a little thing
like that to travel alone. It&#8217;s preposterous&mdash;perfectly
preposterous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unconsciously she finished her thought aloud,
and Josephine heard her, and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean, that big word, Mrs.
Kimono?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means&mdash;my name is&mdash;isn&#8217;t&mdash;no matter.
Are you better? Can you eat? It&#8217;s
small wonder you were upset after the supper
that foolish doctor gave you. What is your
breakfast at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oatmeal and fruit. Sometimes, if I&#8217;m good,
some meat and potato.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will order it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, but I can order for myself.
Mamma always allows me to. She wishes me to
be myself, not anybody else,&#8221; returned the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed! Then do so.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Josephine recognized from the lady&#8217;s tone
that she had given offence, though didn&#8217;t know
why. Now, it was another of her wise mother&#8217;s
rules that her little daughter should punish
herself when any punishment was needed.
Opinions didn&#8217;t always agree upon the subject,
yet, as a rule, the conscientious child could be
trusted to deal with her own faults more sternly
than anybody else would do. She realized that
here was a case in point, and, though the steak
and potatoes which Red Kimono ordered for
herself looked very tempting, asked only for
oatmeal and milk, &#8220;without any sugar, if you
please, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady frowned inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you still ill, Josephine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mrs. Kimono.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you hungry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dreadful.&#8221; Indeed, the hunger was evident
enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you take some heartier food?
If you&#8217;re bashful&mdash; Yet you&#8217;re certainly
not that. If you&#8217;re hungry, child, for goodness
sake eat.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s for goodness sake I can&#8217;t. I daren&#8217;t.
It wouldn&#8217;t be right. Maybe I can eat my
dinner. Maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears were very near the big brown eyes,
but the sweet little face was turned resolutely
away from the table toward the window and
the sights outside. One spoonful of unsweetened,
flavorless meal was gulped down, and the
trembling lips remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all begun again, hasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s begun, Josephine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The all-out-doors to go by and by us, like
it did last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is we who are going by the &#8216;all-out-doors,&#8217;
dear. The train moves, the landscape
stands still. Were you never on the cars
before?&#8221; inquired the lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never, not in all my whole life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! But that&#8217;s not been such a long
time, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another brave effort at the plain breakfast,
and the answer came:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty long to me. It seems&mdash;<i>forever</i>
since yesterday!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>The lady could not endure the sight of
Josephine&#8217;s evident distress and softly slipped
a morsel of juicy steak upon the oatmeal
saucer. With gaze still averted the spoon
came down into the dish, picked up the morsel,
and conveyed it to the reluctant mouth. The
red lips closed, smacked, opened, and the
child faced about. With her napkin to hide
the movement she carefully replaced the morsel
on the empty plate beside the saucer and
said, reproachfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to done that, Mrs. Kimono.
Don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s bad enough to be just
starved, almost, and not be tempted? That&#8217;s
like big Bridget; and my mamma has to speak
right sharp to her, she has. Quite often, too.
Once it was pudding, and I&mdash;I ate it. Then
I had to do myself sorry all over again. Please
&#8217;xcuse me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You strange child! Yes, I will excuse you.
I&#8217;m leaving table myself. You mustn&#8217;t attempt
to go back through the train to our car alone.
Eh? What? Beg pardon?&#8221; she said, turning
around.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>An official in uniform was respectfully addressing
the lady:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, madam, but I think this must be
my little &#8216;Parcel.&#8217; I&#8217;ve been looking for her.
Did you have your breakfast, little girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you enjoyed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t much,&#8221; was her frank reply to
this kind wish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, wasn&#8217;t it right? Here, waiter! I
want you to take this young lady under your
special care. See that she has the best of
everything, and is served promptly, no matter
who else waits. It&#8217;s a point of honor with the
service, madam,&#8221; he explained to the wondering
lady beside them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The service? Beg pardon, but I don&#8217;t
understand. The child seemed to be alone
and I tried to look after her a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for doing so, I&#8217;m sure. The
Express Service, I refer to. I&#8217;m the train
agent between San Diego and Chicago; she
is under my care. There the agent of the
other line takes her in charge. She&#8217;s billed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
through to Baltimore and no expense is to
be spared by anybody concerned, that she
makes the trip in safety and the greatest possible
comfort. We flatter ourselves, madam,
that our company can fix the thing as it should
be. She&#8217;s not the first little human &#8216;parcel&#8217;
we&#8217;ve handled successfully. Is there anything
you&#8217;d like, Miss&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>He paused, pulled a notebook from his
pocket, discovered her name, and concluded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Josephine Smith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith, Josephine Smith, singular!&#8221; murmured
Mrs. Kimono, under her breath. &#8220;But
not so singular after all. Smith is not an uncommon
name, nor Baltimore the only city
where Smiths reside.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the express agent had taken
Josephine&#8217;s hand in his, and was carefully
guiding her back through the many carriages
to the one where she belonged. His statement
that Doctor Mack had put her into his care
made her consider him an old friend, and loosened
her tongue accordingly.</p>

<p>Porter Bob received her with a smile, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
asked if he had arranged her half of the section
to her pleasure; pointed out that Rudanthy&#8217;s
attire had been duly brushed, and begged her
not to hesitate about ringing for him whenever
she needed him.</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Upper Berth, as the child
mentally called her, had returned from her own
breakfast and proved to be &#8220;not half so cross
as you sounded, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>To which the lady replied with a laugh and
the assurance that tired people were apt to be
a &#8220;little crisp,&#8221; then added:</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve heard all about you now, my
dear; and I&#8217;m glad to have as section-mate
such a dainty little &#8216;parcel.&#8217; I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be
the best of friends before we reach our parting-place
at Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they proved to be. So, indeed, did
everybody in the car. &#8220;Little Parcel&#8221; was
made so much of by the grown-up travellers
that she might have been spoiled had the journey
continued longer than it did. But at Chicago
a change was made. The express agent put
her into a carriage, and whisked her away to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
another station, another train, and a new,
strange set of people. Not a face with which
she had become familiar during the first stage
of her long journey was visible. Even Bob had
disappeared, and in his stead was a gray-haired
porter who grumbled at each of the demands,
such as it had become natural for her to make
upon the friendly Bob.</p>

<p>There was no Red Kimono in the section
opposite; not even a be-spectacled Upper Berth
lady to make whimsical comments on her
neighbors; and the new agent to whom she
had been transferred looked cross, as if he were
in a dreadful hurry and hated to be bothered.
Altogether things were changed for the worse,
and Josephine&#8217;s heart would perhaps have
broken if it hadn&#8217;t been for the dear companionship
of Rudanthy, who smiled and slept
in a placid waxen manner that was restfully
familiar.</p>

<p>Besides, all journeys have an end; and the
six days&#8217; trip of the little San Diegan came to
its own before the door of a stately mansion,
gay with the red brick and white marble which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
mark most Baltimore homes, and the ring of an
electric bell that the expressman touched:</p>

<p>&#8220;A &#8216;parcel&#8217; for Joseph Smith. Billed from
San Diego, Cal. Live here, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a colored man in livery who replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, suh. Mister Joseph Smith, he done
live here, suh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sign, please. That is, if you can write.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course I can write. I allays signs parcels
for Mister Smith, suh. Where&#8217;s the parcel at,
suh?&#8221; returned the liveried negro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sign. I&#8217;ll fetch it,&#8221; came the prompt
answer.</p>

<p>Old Peter signed, being the trusted and
trustworthy servant of his master, and returned
the book to the agent&#8217;s hands, who himself
returned to the carriage, lifted out Josephine
and Rudanthy, conveyed them up the glistening
steps, and left them to their fate.</p>

<small>ARRIVAL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> stared, but said nothing. Not even
when the agent ran back from the carriage with
a little satchel and a strap full of shawls and
picture-books. The hack rolled away, the
keen March wind chilled the young Californian,
who stood, doll in hand, respectfully waiting
admission to the warm hall beyond the door.
Finally, since the servant seemed to have been
stricken speechless, she found her own voice,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, boy, I&#8217;d like to see my Uncle Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your&mdash;Uncle&mdash;Joe, little miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said. I must come in. I&#8217;m
very cold. If this is Baltimore, that the folks
on the cars said was pretty, I guess they didn&#8217;t
know what they were talking about. I want
to come in, please.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>The old man found his wits returning.
This was the queerest &#8220;parcel&#8221; for which he
had ever signed a receipt in an express-book,
and he knew there was some mistake. Yet he
couldn&#8217;t withstand the pleading brown eyes
under the scarlet hat, even if he hadn&#8217;t been
&#8220;raised&#8221; to a habit of hospitality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suah, little lady. Come right in. &#8217;Tis
dreadful cold out to-day. I &#8217;most froze goin&#8217;
to market, an&#8217; I&#8217;se right down ashamed of
myself leavin&#8217; comp&#8217;ny waitin&#8217; this way. Step
right in the drawin&#8217;-room, little missy, and
tell me who &#8217;tis you&#8217;d like to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Picking up the luggage that had been deposited
on the topmost of the gleaming marble
steps, which, even in winter, unlike his neighbors,
the master of the house disdained to hide
beneath a wooden casing, the negro led the
way into the luxurious parlor. To Josephine,
fresh from the chill of the cloudy, windy day
without, the whole place seemed aglow. A
rosy light came through the red-curtained
windows, shone from the open grate, repeated
itself in the deep crimson carpet that was so
delightfully soft and warm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;Sit down by the fire, little lady. There.
That&#8217;s nice. Put your dolly right here.
Maybe she&#8217;s cold, too. Now, then, suah
you&#8217;se fixed so fine you can tell me who &#8217;tis
you&#8217;ve come to see,&#8221; said the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name, boy?&#8221; inquired
Josephine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter, missy. My name&#8217;s Peter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, Peter, don&#8217;t be stupid. Or are
you deaf, maybe?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Land, no, missy. I&#8217;se got my hearin&#8217; fust
class,&#8221; he replied, somewhat indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to see my Uncle Joe. I wish
to see him now. Please tell him,&#8221; she commanded.</p>

<p>The negro scratched his gray wool and
reflected. He had been born and raised in the
service of the family where he still &#8220;officiated,&#8221;
and knew its history thoroughly. His present
master was the only son of an only son, and
there had never been a daughter. No, nor
wife, at least to this household. There were
cousins in plenty, with whom Mr. Joseph
Smith was not on good terms. There were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
property interests dividing them, and Mr.
Joseph kept his vast wealth for his own use
alone. Some thought he should have shared it
with others, but he did not so think and lived
his quiet life, with a trio of colored men-servants.
His house was one of the best
appointed on the wide avenue, but, also, one
of the quietest. It was the first time that old
Peter had ever heard a child&#8217;s voice in that
great room, and its clear tones seemed to
confuse him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see my Uncle Joe. I want to
see him right away. Go, boy, and call him,&#8221;
Josephine explained.</p>

<p>This was command, and Peter was used to
obey, so he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, little missy, I&#8217;ll go see. Has
you got your card? Who shall I say &#8217;tis?&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine reflected. Once mamma had had
some dear little visiting cards engraved with
her small daughter&#8217;s name, and the child
remembered with regret that if they had been
packed with her &#8220;things&#8221; at all, it must have
been in the trunk, which the expressman said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
would arrive by and by from the railway station.
She could merely say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncles don&#8217;t need cards when their folks
come to see them. I&#8217;ve come from mamma.
She&#8217;s gone to the pickley land to see papa.
Just tell him Josephine. What&#8217;s that stuff
out there?&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran to the window, pulled the lace
curtains apart, and peered out. The air was
now full of great white flakes that whirled and
skurried about as if in the wildest sort of play.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Peter? Quick, what is it?&#8221;
she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Don&#8217;t you know snow when you
see it, little missy? Where you lived at all
your born days?&#8221; he cried, surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just snow. Course I&#8217;ve seen it,
coming here on the cars. It was on the
ground, though, not in the air and the sky.
I&#8217;ve lived with mamma. Now I&#8217;ve come to
live with Uncle Joe. Why don&#8217;t you tell him?
If a lady called to see my mamma do you
s&#8217;pose big Bridget wouldn&#8217;t say so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;se goin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, and went.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>But he was gone so long, and the expected
uncle was so slow to welcome her, that even
that beautiful room began to look dismal to the
little stranger. The violent storm which had
sprung up with such suddenness, darkened the
air, and a terrible homesickness threatened to
bring on a burst of tears. Then, all at once,
Josephine remembered what Doctor Mack had
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a weeper, little lady, whatever
else you are. Be a smiler, like my Cousin
Helen, your mamma. You&#8217;re pretty small to
tackle the world alone, but just do it with a
laugh and it will laugh back upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not all of which she understood, though she
recalled every one of the impressive words,
but the &#8220;laughing part&#8221; was plain enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Course, Rudanthy. No Uncle Joe would
be glad to get a crying little girl to his house.
I&#8217;ll take off my coat and yours, darling. You
are pretty tired, I guess. I wonder where
they&#8217;ll let us sleep, that black boy and my
uncle. I hope the room will have a pretty
fire in it, like this one. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Rudanthy did not answer, but as Josephine
laid her flat upon the carpet, to remove her
travelling cloak, she immediately closed her
waxen lids, and her little mother took this for
assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you sweetest thing! How I do love
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>There followed a close hug of the faithful
doll, which was witnessed by a trio of colored
men from a rear door, where they stood, open-eyed
and mouthed, wondering what in the
world the master would say when he returned
and found this little trespasser upon his hearth-stone.</p>

<p>When Rudanthy had been embraced, to the
detriment of her jute ringlets and her mistress&#8217;
comfort, Josephine curled down on the rug
before the grate to put the doll asleep,
observing:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so cold, Rudanthy. Colder than I
am, even. Your precious hands are like ice.
You must lie right here close to the fire, &#8217;tween
me and it. By-and-by Uncle Joe will come
and then&mdash;My! Won&#8217;t he be surprised?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
That Peter boy is so dreadful stupid, like&#8217;s
not he&#8217;ll forget to say a single word about us.
Never mind. He&#8217;s my papa&#8217;s twin brother.
Do you know what twins are, Rudanthy? I do.
Big Bridget&#8217;s sister&#8217;s got a pair of them.
They&#8217;re two of a kind, though sometimes one
of them is the other kind. I mean, you know,
sometimes one twin isn&#8217;t a brother, it&#8217;s a sister.
That&#8217;s what big Bridget&#8217;s sister&#8217;s was.
Oh, dear. I&#8217;m tired. I&#8217;m hungry. I liked
it better on that nice first railway car where
everybody took care of me and gave me
sweeties. It&#8217;s terrible still here. I&mdash;I&#8217;m
afraid I&#8217;m going to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another moment the fear of the weary
little traveller had become a fact. Rudanthy
was already slumbering; and, alas! that was
to prove the last of her many naps. But
Josephine was unconscious of the grief awaiting
her own awakening; and, fortunately, too young
to know what a different welcome should have
been accorded herself by the relative she had
come so far to visit.</p>

<p>Peter peeped in, from time to time, found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
all peaceful, and retired in thankfulness for the
temporary lull. He was trembling in his
shoes against the hour when the master should
return and find him so unfaithful to his trust
as to have admitted that curly-haired intruder
upon their dignified privacy. Yet he encouraged
himself with the reflection:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no need crossin&#8217; no bridges till you
meet up with &#8217;em, and this bridge ain&#8217;t a crossin&#8217;
till Massa Joe&#8217;s key turns in that lock.
Reckon I was guided to pick out that fine duck
for dinner this night, I do. S&#8217;posin&#8217;, now, the
market had been poor? Huh! Every trouble
sets better on a full stummick &#8217;an a empty.
Massa Joe&#8217;s powerful fond of duck, lessen it&#8217;s
spoiled in the cookin&#8217;. I&#8217;ll go warn that &#8217;Pollo
to be mighty careful it done to a turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter departed kitchen ward, where he tarried
gossipping over the small guest above stairs and
the probable outcome of her advent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody what&#8217;s a Christian goin&#8217; to turn a
little gell outen their doors such an evenin&#8217; as
this,&#8221; said Apollo, deftly basting the fowl in
the pan.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_042.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;I&#8217;M JOSEPHINE!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;Mebbe not, mebbe not. But I reckon we
can&#8217;t, none of us, callate on whatever Massa
Joe&#8217;s goin&#8217; to do about anything till he does it.
He&#8217;s off to a board meeting, this evening, and
I hope he sets on it comfortable. When them
boards are too hard, like, he comes home
mighty &#8217;rascible. Keep a right smart watch
on that bird, &#8217;Pollo, won&#8217;t you? whiles I go
lay the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>But here another question arose to puzzle
the old man. Should he, or should he not,
prepare that table for the unexpected guest?
There was nobody more particular than Mr.
Smith that all his orders should be obeyed to
the letter. Each evening he wished his dinner
to be served after one prescribed fashion, and
any infraction of his rules brought a reprimand
to Peter.</p>

<p>However, in this case he determined to
risk a little for hospitality&#8217;s sake, reflecting
that if the master were displeased he could
whisk off the extra plate before it was discovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Massa Joe&#8217;s just as like to scold if I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
put it on as if I do. Never allays account for
what&#8217;ll please him best. Depends on how he
takes it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Busy in his dining-room he did not hear the
cab roll over the snowy street and stop at the
door, nor the turn of the key in the lock. Nor,
lost in his own thoughts, did the master of the
house summon a servant to help him off with
his coat and overshoes. He repaired immediately
to his library, arranged a few papers,
went to his dressing-room and attired himself
for dinner, with the carefulness to which he
had been trained from childhood, and afterward
strolled leisurely toward the great parlor,
turned on the electric light, and paused upon
its threshold amazed, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this? What in the world is&mdash;<i>this</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sudden radiance which touched her eyelids,
rather than his startled exclamation,
roused small Josephine from her restful nap.
She sat up, rubbed her eyes, which brightened
with a radiance beyond that of electricity, and
sprang to her feet. With outstretched arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
she flung herself upon the astonished gentleman,
crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you beautiful, beautiful man! You
darling, precious Uncle Joe! I&#8217;m Josephine!
I&#8217;ve come!&#8221;</p>

<small>A MULTITUDE OF JOSEPHS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;So</span> I perceive!&#8221; responded the master of
the house, when he could rally from this onslaught
of affection. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m very
pleased to welcome you. I&mdash;when&mdash;how
did you arrive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a &#8217;xpress &#8216;parcel,&#8217;&#8221; she answered,
laughing, for she had learned before this that
she had made her long journey in rather an
unusual fashion. &#8220;Mamma had to go away on
the peacock-blue ocean; and Doctor Mack
couldn&#8217;t bother with me, &#8217;cause he&#8217;s going to
the folks that eat almonds together and give
presents; and there wasn&#8217;t anybody else &#8217;xcept
big Bridget, and she&#8217;d spent all her money,
and mamma said you wouldn&#8217;t want a &#8216;wild
Irish girl&#8217; to plague you. Would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not fond of being plagued by anybody,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
said the gentleman, rather dryly. He
was puzzled as much by her odd talk as her
unexpected appearance, and wondered if children
so young were ever lunatics. The better
to consider the matter he sat down in the nearest
chair, and instantly Josephine was upon
his knee. The sensation this gave him was
most peculiar. He didn&#8217;t remember that he
had ever taken any child on his lap, yet
permitted this one to remain there, because he
didn&#8217;t know what better to do. He had heard
that one should treat a lunatic as if all vagaries
were real. Opposition only made an insane
person worse. What worse could this little
crazy creature, with the lovely face and dreadful
manners, do to a finical old bachelor in evening
clothes than crush the creases out of his
trouser knees?</p>

<p>The lap was not as comfortable as Doctor
Mack&#8217;s, and far, far from as cosey as mamma&#8217;s.
Uncle Joe&#8217;s long legs had a downward slant to
them that made Josephine&#8217;s perch upon them
rather uncertain. After sliding toward the
floor once or twice, and hitching up again, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
slipped to her feet and leaned affectionately
against his shoulder, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better. I guess you&#8217;re not used to
holding little girls, are you, Uncle Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Josephine. What is your other name?&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith. Just like yours. You&#8217;re my papa&#8217;s
dear twin, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, am I?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Course. Didn&#8217;t you know that? How
funny. That&#8217;s because you haven&#8217;t mamma to
remind you, I s&#8217;pose. Mamma remembers
everything. Mamma never is naughty. Mamma
knows everything. Mamma is dear, dear, dear.
And, oh, I want her, I want her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine&#8217;s arms went round the gentleman&#8217;s
neck, and her tears fell freely upon his spotless
shirt-front. She had been very brave, she had
done what she promised Doctor Mack, and kept
a &#8220;laughing front&#8221; as long as she could; but
now here, in the home of her papa&#8217;s twin, with
her &#8220;own folks,&#8221; her self-control gave way, and
she cried as she had never cried before in all
her short and happy life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Mr. Smith was hopelessly distressed. He
didn&#8217;t know what to say or do, and this proved
most fortunate for both of them. For whatever
he might have said would have puzzled his
visitor as greatly as she was puzzling him.
Happily for both, the deluge of tears was soon
over, and Josephine lifted a face on which the
smiles seemed all the brighter because of the
moisture that still bedewed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please &#8217;xcuse me, Uncle Joe. I didn&#8217;t
mean to cry once, but it&mdash;it&#8217;s so lovely to have
you at last. It was a long, long way on the
railway, uncle. Rudanthy got terribly tired,&#8221;
explained the visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she? Who is Rudanthy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You, my uncle, yet don&#8217;t know Rudanthy,
that has been mine ever since I was? Mamma
says she has to change heads now and then,
and once in awhile she buys her a new
pair of feet or hands; but it&#8217;s the same darling
dolly, whether her head&#8217;s new or old.
I&#8217;ll fetch her. It&#8217;s time she waked up, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine sped to the rug before the grate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
stooped to lift her playmate, paused, and
uttered a terrified cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle! Uncle Joe, come here quick&mdash;quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Smiling at his own acquiescence, the gentleman
obeyed her demand, and stooped over her
as she also bent above the object on the rug.
All that was left of poor Rudanthy&mdash;who had
travelled three thousand miles to be melted into
a shapeless mass before the first hearth-fire
which received her.</p>

<p>Josephine did not cry now. This was a
trouble too deep for tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails her, Uncle Joe? I never, never
saw her look like that. Her nose and her lips
and her checks are all flattened out, and her
eyes&mdash;her eyes are just round glass balls.
Her lovely curls&#8221;&mdash; The little hands flew to
the top of the speaker&#8217;s own head, but found
no change there. Yet she looked up rather
anxiously into the face above her. &#8220;Do you
s&#8217;pose I&#8217;d have got to look that dreadful way
if I hadn&#8217;t waked up when I did, Uncle Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Josephine. No, indeed. Your unhappy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Rudanthy was a waxen young person
who was indiscreet enough to lie down before
an open fire. You seem to be real flesh and
blood, and might easily scorch, yet would hardly
melt. Next time you take a nap, however, I&#8217;d
advise you to lie on a lounge or a bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will. I wouldn&#8217;t like to look like her.
But what shall I do? I don&#8217;t know a store
here,&#8221; she wailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. I might be able to find you a new
doll, if you won&#8217;t cry,&#8221; came the answer which
surprised himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I shan&#8217;t cry any more. Never any
more&mdash;if I can help it. That&#8217;s a promise.
But I shouldn&#8217;t want a new doll. I only want
a head. Poor Rudanthy! Do you s&#8217;pose she
suffered much?&#8221; was the next anxious question.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not likely. But let Rudanthy lie yonder
on the cool window sill. I want to talk
with you. I want you to answer a few questions.
Sit down by me, please. Is this comfortable?&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine sank into the midst of the cushions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
he piled for her on the wide sofa and sighed
luxuriously, answering:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lovely. This is the nicest place I ever,
ever saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. Now, child, tell me something
about other places you remember, and, also,
please tell me your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine was surprised. What a very short
memory this uncle had, to be sure. It wouldn&#8217;t
be polite to say so, though, and it was an easy
question to answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Josephine Smith. I&#8217;m named
after you, you know, &#8217;cause you&#8217;re my papa&#8217;s
twin. I&#8217;m sent to you because&#8221;&mdash;and she went
on to explain the reasons, so far as she understood
them, of her long journey and her presence
in his house. She brought her coat and
showed him, neatly sewed inside its flap, a
square of glazed holland on which was written
her name, to whom consigned, and the express
company by which she had been &#8220;specially
shipped and delivered.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was all plain and straightforward. This
was the very house designated on the tag, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
he was Joseph Smith; but it was, also, a riddle
too deep for him to guess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see, I see. Well, since you are here we
must make the best of it. I think there&#8217;s a
mistake, but I dare say the morning will set
it all right. Meanwhile, it&#8217;s snowing too fast
to make any inquiries to-night. It is about
dinner time, for me. Have you had your dinner?&#8221;
asked the host.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had one on the train. That seems a
great while ago,&#8221; said the guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg pardon, but I think there is a little
smut upon your pretty nose. After a railway
journey travellers usually like to wash up, and
so on. I don&#8217;t know much about little girls,
yet&#8221;&mdash;he rather timidly suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be so glad. Just see my hands,
Uncle Joe!&#8221; and she extended a pair of plump
palms which sadly needed soap and water.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not your&#8221;&mdash;he began, meaning to set
her right concerning their relationship; then
thought better of it. What would a child do
who had come to visit an unknown uncle and
found herself in the home of a stranger?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Weep, most likely. He didn&#8217;t want that.
He&#8217;d had enough of tears, as witness one
spoiled shirt-front. He began also to change
his mind regarding the little one&#8217;s manners.
She had evidently lived with gentlefolks and
when some one came to claim her in the
morning he would wish them to understand
that she had been treated courteously.</p>

<p>So he rang for Peter, who appeared as suddenly
as if he had come from the hall without.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been listening at the doorway, boy? Take
care. Go up to the guest room, turn on the
heat and light, and see that there are plenty of
fresh towels. Take this young lady&#8217;s things
with you. She will probably spend the night
here. I hope you have a decent dinner provided.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, Massa Joe. Just supreme. Yes,
suh. Certainly, suh,&#8221; answered the servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Joe, is there a bathroom in this
house?&#8221; asked she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three of them, Josephine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I use one? I haven&#8217;t had a bath since
I was in San Diego, and I&#8217;m&mdash;mamma would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
not allow me at table, I guess; I&#8217;m dreadful
dirty.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Josephine had tried to find the shortest
way to Mr. Smith&#8217;s heart she could not have
chosen more wisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure, to be sure. Peter, make a
bath ready next the guest room. Will an
hour give you time enough, little lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want so long. I&#8217;m so glad I
learned to dress myself, aren&#8217;t you? &#8217;Cause
all the women to this house seem to be men,
don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, child. Poor, unfortunate house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful house, Uncle Joe; and you
needn&#8217;t care any more. I&#8217;ve come, now. I,
Josephine. I&#8217;ll take care of you. Good-by.
When you see me again I&#8217;ll be looking lovely,
&#8217;cause I&#8217;ll put on the new white wool dress
that mamma embroidered with forget-me-nots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vanity!&#8221; thought Mr. Smith, regretfully,
which shows that he didn&#8217;t as yet understand
his little visitor, whose &#8220;lovely&#8221; referred to
her clothes alone, and not at all to herself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>The dinner hour at 1000 Bismarck Avenue
was precisely half-past six. Even for the
most notable of the few guests entertained by
the master of the house he rarely delayed more
than five minutes, and on no occasion had it
been served a moment earlier. The old-fashioned
hall clock had ticked the hour for generations
of Smiths &#8220;from Virginia,&#8221; and was
regulated nowadays by the tower timepiece
at Mt. Royal station. It was fortunate for
Josephine that just as the minute hand dropped
to its place, midway between the six and seven
on the dial, she came tripping down the wide
stair, radiant from her bath and the comfort of
fresh clothing, and eager to be again with the
handsome Uncle Joe, who was waiting for her
at the stair&#8217;s foot with some impatience.</p>

<p>Her promptness pleased him, and the uncommon
vision of her childish loveliness
pleased him even more. He had believed that
he disliked children, but was now inclined to
change his opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you are punctual, Miss Josephine,
else I&#8217;d have had to begin my dinner without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
you. I never put back meals for anybody,&#8221;
he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you? Don&#8217;t you? Then I&#8217;m glad,
too. Isn&#8217;t the frock pretty? My mamma
worked all these flowers with her own little
white hands. I love it. I had to kiss them
before I could put it on,&#8221; she said, again lifting
her skirt and touching it with her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you love your mamma very
dearly. What is she like?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was leading her along the hall toward the
dining-room, and Peter, standing within its entrance,
congratulated himself that he had laid
the table for two. He glanced at his master&#8217;s
face, found it good-natured and interested, and
took his own cue therefrom.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is like&mdash;she is like the most beautiful
thing in the world, dear Uncle Joe. Don&#8217;t
you remember?&#8221; asked the astonished child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, not exactly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pity, and you my papa&#8217;s twin.
Papa hasn&#8217;t nice gray hair like yours, though,
and there isn&#8217;t any shiny bare place on top of
his head. I mean there wasn&#8217;t when he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
away last year. His hair was dark, like mamma&#8217;s,
and his mustache was brown and curly.
I think he isn&#8217;t as big as you, Uncle Joe, and
his clothes are gray, with buttony fixings on
them. He has a beautiful sash around his
waist, sometimes, and lovely shoulder trimmings.
He&#8217;s an officer, my papa is, in Company
F. That&#8217;s for &#8217;musement, mamma says.
For the business, he&#8217;s a &#8217;lectrickeller. Is this
my place? Thank you, Peter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Smith handed his little visitor to her
chair, which the old butler had pulled back for
her, with the same courtly manner he would
have shown the pastor&#8217;s wife. Indeed, if he
had been asked he would have admitted that
he found the present guest the more interesting
of the two.</p>

<p>Peter made ready to serve the soup, but a
look from the strange child restrained him.
She added a word to the look:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, boy, you forgot. Uncle Joe hasn&#8217;t
said the grace yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Smith was a faithful and devout
church member, but was in the habit of omitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
this little ceremony at his solitary meals.
He was disconcerted for the moment, but presently
bowed his head and repeated the formula
to which he had been accustomed in his youth.
It proved to be the same that the little girl was
used to hearing from her own parents&#8217; lips, and
she believed it to be the ordinary habit of every
household. She did not dream that she had
instituted a new order of things, and unfolded
her napkin with a smile, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m dreadful hungry, Uncle Joe.
Are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I am, little one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter served with much dignity and flourish;
but Josephine had dined at hotel tables often
enough to accept his attentions as a matter of
course. Her quiet behavior, her daintiness,
and her chatter, amused and delighted her host.
He found himself in a much better humor than
when he returned through the storm from an
unsatisfactory board meeting, and was grateful
for the mischance which had brought him such
pleasant company.</p>

<p>As for old Peter, his dark face glowed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
enthusiasm. He was deeply religious, and
now believed that this unknown child had
been sent by heaven itself to gladden their
big, empty house. He didn&#8217;t understand
how his master could be &#8220;uncle&#8221; to anybody,
yet, since that master accepted the fact
so genially, he was only too glad to do likewise.</p>

<p>It was a fine and stately dinner, and as course
after course was served, Josephine&#8217;s wonder
grew, till she had to inquire:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it like this always, to your home, Uncle
Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a birthday table, and no folks, &#8217;xcept
you and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the same, usually, unless Peter fails
to find a good market. Have you finished?
No more cream or cake?&#8221; he explained and
questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you. I&#8217;m never asked to take
two helpings. Only on the car I had three,
sometimes, though I didn&#8217;t eat them. Mamma
wouldn&#8217;t have liked it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>&#8220;And do you always remember what &#8216;mamma&#8217;
wishes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m a terrible forgetter. But I try.
Somehow it&#8217;s easier now I can&#8217;t see her,&#8221; she
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite natural. Suppose we go into the
library for a little while. I want to consult
the directory.&#8221;</p>

<p>She clasped his hand, looked up confidingly,
but felt as if she should fall asleep on the way
thither. She wondered if it ever came bedtime
in that house, and how many hours had passed
since she entered it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Miss Josephine, I think you&#8217;ll find
that chair a comfortable one,&#8221; said the host,
when they had reached the library, rich with
all that is desirable in such a room. &#8220;Do you
like pictures?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I love them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. So do I. I&#8217;ll get you
some.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mr. Smith was not used to the &#8220;loves&#8221;
of little girls, and his selection was made rather
because he wanted to see how she would handle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
a book than because he thought about the subject
chosen. A volume of Dore&#8217;s grotesque
drawings happened to be in most shabby condition,
and he reflected that she &#8220;couldn&#8217;t hurt
that much, anyway, for it&#8217;s to be rebound.&#8221;</p>

<p>Afterward he opened the directory for himself,
and Josephine thought it a dull-looking
book. For some time both were interested
and silent; then Uncle Joe cried out with
startling suddenness:</p>

<p>&#8220;Three thousand Smiths in this little city;
and seventy-five of them are Josephs! Well,
my child, you&#8217;re mighty rich in &#8216;uncles&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />


<small>A WILD MARCH MORNING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Josephine</span> was half-asleep. A woman
would have thought about her fatigue and sent
her early to bed. &#8220;Uncle Joe&#8221; thought of
nothing now save the array of common and
uncommon names in the city directory. He
counted and recounted the &#8220;Smiths,&#8221; &#8220;Smyths,&#8221;
and &#8220;Smythes,&#8221; and jotted down his figures in
a notebook. He copied, also, any address of
any Smith whose residence was in a locality
which he considered suitable for relatives of his
small guest. He became so absorbed in this
study that an hour had passed before he remembered
her, and the extraordinary quiet of
her lively tongue.</p>

<p>Josephine had dozed and waked, dozed and
waked, and dreamed many dreams during that
hour of silence. Her tired little brain was all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
confused with the weird pictures of tortured
men gazing at her from the trunks of gnarled
trees, and thoughts of a myriad of uncles, each
wearing eyeglasses, and sitting with glistening
bald head beneath a brilliant light. The light
dazzled her, the dreams terrified her, and the
little face that dropped at length upon the open
page of the great folio was drawn and distressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;For goodness sake! I suppose she&#8217;s
sleepy. I believe that children do go to bed
early. At least they should. If I&#8217;m to be a
correct sort of &#8216;uncle,&#8217; even for one night, I
must get her there. I wonder how!&#8221; considered
the gentleman.</p>

<p>The first thing was to wake her, and he
attempted it, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Josephine! Josephine!&#8221;</p>

<p>The child stirred uneasily, but slumbered
on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Joe&#8221; laid his hand upon her shoulder
rather gingerly. He was much more afraid of
her than she could ever be of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Josephine! If you please, wake up.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>She responded with a suddenness that startled
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;where am I? Oh! I know. Did I
go to sleep, Uncle Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should judge that you did. Would you
like to go to bed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please, uncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled faintly at the odd situation in
which he found himself, playing nurse to a
little girl. A boy would have been less disconcerting,
for he had been a boy himself,
once, and remembered his childhood. But he
had never been a little girl, had never lived in
a house with a little girl, and didn&#8217;t know how
little girls expected to be treated. He volunteered
one question:</p>

<p>&#8220;If somebody takes you to your room, could
you&mdash;could you do the rest for yourself,
Josephine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, course. I began when I was eight
years old. That was my last birthday that
ever was. Big Bridget was not to wait on me
any more after that, mamma said. But she
did. She loved it. Mamma, even, loved it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
too. And nobody need go upstairs with me.
I know the way. I remember it all. If&mdash; May
I say my prayers by you, Uncle Joe?
Mamma&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>One glance about the strange room, one
thought of the absent mother, and the little
girl&#8217;s lip quivered. Then came a second
thought, and she remembered her promise.
She was never to cry again, if she could help
it. By winking very fast and thinking about
other things than mamma and home she would
be able to help it.</p>

<p>Before he touched her shoulder to wake her,
Mr. Smith had rung for Peter, who now stood
waiting orders in the parting of the porti&egrave;re,
and beheld a sight such as he had never
dreamed to see in that great, lonely house:
Josephine kneeling reverently beside his master&#8217;s
knee, saying aloud the Lord&#8217;s Prayer and
the familiar &#8220;Now I lay me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she rose, flung her arms about the
gentleman&#8217;s neck, saw the moisture in his eyes,
and asked in surprise:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;NOW I LAY ME.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you feel bad, Uncle Joe? Aren&#8217;t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
happy, Uncle Joe? Can&#8217;t I help you, you
dear, dear man?&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;dear&#8221; man&#8217;s arms went round the
little figure, and he drew it close to his lonely
heart with a jealous wish that he might always
keep it there. All at once he felt that he
hated that other unknown, rightful uncle to
whom this charming &#8220;parcel&#8221; belonged, and
almost he wished that no such person might
ever be found. Then he unclasped her clinging
arms and&mdash;actually kissed her!</p>

<p>&#8220;You are helping me very greatly, Josephine.
You are a dear child. Peter will see that your
room is all right for the night. Tell him anything
you need and he&#8217;ll get it for you. Good-night,
little girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Uncle Joe. Dear Uncle Joe.
I think&mdash;I think you are just too sweet for
words! I hope you&#8217;ll rest well. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She vanished through the curtains, looking
back and kissing her finger-tips to him, and
smiling trustingly upon him to the last. But
the old man sat long looking after her before
he turned again to his books, reflecting:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;Strange! Only a few hours of a child&#8217;s
presence in this silent place, yet it seems transfigured.
&#8216;An angel&#8217;s visit,&#8217; maybe. To show
me that, after all, I am something softer and
more human than the crusty old bachelor I
thought myself. What would her mother say,
that absent, perfect &#8216;mamma,&#8217; if she knew into
what strange hands her darling had fallen?
Of course, my first duty to-morrow is to hunt
up this mislaid uncle of little Josephine&#8217;s and
restore her to him. But&mdash;Well, it&#8217;s my duty,
and of course I shall do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great bed in the guest room was big
enough, Josephine thought, to have held
mamma herself, and even big Bridget without
crowding. It was far softer than her own
little white cot in the San Diegan cottage, and
plunged in its great depths the small traveller
instantly fell asleep. She did not hear Peter
come in and lower the light, and knew nothing
more, indeed, till morning. Then she roused
with a confused feeling, not quite realizing
where she was or what had happened to her.
For a few moments she lay still, expecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
mamma&#8217;s or big Bridget&#8217;s face to appear
beneath the silken curtains which draped the
bed&#8217;s head; then she remembered everything,
and that in a house without women she was
bound to do all things for herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s dreadful dark everywhere. I
guess I don&#8217;t like such thick curtains as Uncle
Joe has. Mamma&#8217;s are thin white ones and
it&#8217;s always sunshiny at home&mdash;&#8217;xcept when it
isn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s only when the rains come, and
that&#8217;s most always the nicest of all. Then we
have a dear little fire in the grate, and mamma
reads to me, and big Bridget bakes and cooks
the best things. We write letters to papa,
and mamma sings and plays, and&mdash;it&#8217;s just
lovely! Never mind, Josephine. You&#8217;ll be
back there soon&#8217;s papa gets well again, and
Uncle Joe was sort of cryey round his eyes
last night. Mamma said I was to be like his
own little daughter to him and take care of
him and never make him any trouble. So I
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no prouder child in that city that
morning than the little stranger within its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
gates. She prepared her bath without aid,
brushed her hair and dressed herself entirely.
It was true that her curls did not look much as
they did after mamma&#8217;s loving fingers had
handled them, and the less said about those on
the back of her head the better. Nor were the
buttons in the right places to match the buttonholes,
and the result was that the little
frock which had always been so tidy hung at a
curious angle from its wearer&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>But who&#8217;d mind a trifle like that, in a
beginner?</p>

<p>Not Uncle Joe, who saw only the fair front
of his visitor, as she ran down the hall to meet
him, emerging from his own chamber. Indeed,
he was not now in a mood to observe
anything save himself, though he answered
Josephine&#8217;s gay &#8220;Good morning&#8221; with another
rather grimly spoken.</p>

<p>The child paused, astonished. There were
no longer tears in his eyes, but he looked as
if a &#8220;good cry&#8221; would be relief. His face
was distorted with pain, and every time he put
one of his feet to the floor he winced as if it hurt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
him. He seemed as dim and glum as the day
outside, and that was dreary beyond anything
the little Californian had ever seen. The
snow had fallen steadily all the night, and the
avenue was almost impassable. A few milk-carts
forced their way along, and a man in a
gray uniform, with a leather bag over his
shoulder, was wading up each flight of steps to
the doorways above them and handing in the
morning mail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you well, Uncle Joe? Didn&#8217;t you
rest well?&#8221; she inquired solicitously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve got that wretched old gout again,&#8221;
he snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a horrible, useless, nerve-racking &#8216;misery&#8217;
in my foot. It&#8217;s being out in that storm
yesterday, and this senseless heap of snow on
the ground. March is supposed to be spring,
but this beastly climate doesn&#8217;t know what
spring means. Ugh!&#8221; he groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she asked, amazed by this
statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum, child. There&#8217;s no need of your repeating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
everything I say in another question.
I&#8217;m always cross when I&#8217;m gouty. Don&#8217;t heed
me. Just enjoy yourself the best you can, for
I don&#8217;t see how I&#8217;m to hunt up your uncle for
you in such weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine thought he was talking queerly,
but said nothing; only followed him slowly to
the breakfast room, which Peter had done his
best to make cheerful.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith sat down at table and began to
open the pile of letters which lay beside his
plate. Then he unfolded his newspaper, looked
at a few items, and sipped his coffee. He had
forgotten Josephine, though she had not forgotten
him, and sat waiting until such time as
it should please him to ask the blessing.</p>

<p>For the sake of her patient yet eager face,
Peter took an unheard-of liberty: he nudged
his master&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey? What? Peter!&#8221; angrily demanded
Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, suh. Certainly, suh. But I reckon
little missy won&#8217;t eat withouten it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was almost as disagreeable to the gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
to be reminded of his duty, and that, too,
by a servant, as to suffer his present physical
pangs. But he swallowed the lesson with the
remainder of his coffee, and bowed his head,
resolving that never again while that brown-eyed
child sat opposite him should such a reminder
be necessary.</p>

<p>As before, with the conclusion of the simple
grace, Josephine&#8217;s tongue and appetite were
released from guard, and she commented:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is an awful funny Baltimore, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Do you always state a thing
and then ask it?&#8221; returned Uncle Joe, crisply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;xpect I do ask a heap of questions.
Mamma has to correct me sometimes. But I
can&#8217;t help it, can I? How shall I know things
I don&#8217;t know if I don&#8217;t ask folks that do know,
you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be a very knowing young person if
you keep on,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I want to be. I want to know every
single thing there is in the whole world. Papa
used to say there was a &#8216;why&#8217; always, and I
like to find out the &#8216;whys.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;I believe you. Peter, another chop, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With your foot, Massa Joe?&#8221; remonstrated
the butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. With my roll and fresh cup of coffee,&#8221;
was the retort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Massa Joe, but you told me
last time that next time I was to remember you
&#8217;bout the doctor saying &#8216;no meat with the
gout.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctors know little. I&#8217;m hungry. If I&#8217;ve
got to suffer I might as well be hung for a sheep
as a lamb. I&#8217;ve already eaten two chops. Another,
Peter, and a juicy one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The order was obeyed, though the old negro
knew that soon he would be reprimanded as
much for yielding to his master&#8217;s whim as he
had already been for opposing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Mack knows everything,&#8221; said Josephine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Everybody belonging to you is perfect,
I conclude,&#8221; said the host, with some sarcasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like him, though. Not very well.
He gives me medicine sometimes, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
mamma says I don&#8217;t need it. I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s
gone to eat those philopenas. Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a rap where he goes,&#8221; answered
Uncle Joe testily.</p>

<p>Josephine opened her eyes to their widest.
This old man in the soiled green dressing-gown,
unshaven, frowning and wincing in a horrible
manner, was like another person to the handsome
gentleman with whom she had dined overnight.
He was not half so agreeable, and&mdash; Well,
mamma often said that nobody in this
world had a right to be &#8220;cross&#8221; and make
themselves unpleasant to other people. She
was sorry for poor Uncle Joe, and remembered
that he had not had the advantage of mamma&#8217;s
society and wisdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Joe, you look just like one of them
picture-men that was shut up in a tree trunk.
You know. You showed them to me last night.
I wish you wouldn&#8217;t make up such a face,&#8221; she
observed.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith&#8217;s mouth flew open in sheer amazement,
while Peter tossed his hands aloft and
rolled his eyes till the whites alone were visible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
In all his service he had never heard anybody
dare to speak so plainly to his master, whose
temper was none of the mildest. He dreaded
what would follow, and was more astonished
than ever when it proved to be a quiet:</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Children and fools speak truth,
&#8217;tis said. You&#8217;re a sharp-eyed, unflattering
little lady, Miss Josephine; but I&#8217;ll try to control
my ugly visage for your benefit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tone in which this was said, rather than
the words themselves, was a reproof to the
child, who immediately left her place, ran to
her uncle&#8217;s side, and laid her hand pleadingly
upon his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please forgive me, poor Uncle Joe. I
guess that was saucy. I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t think.
That&#8217;s a way I have. I say things first, and
think them afterward. I guess it isn&#8217;t a nice
way. I&#8217;ll try to get over that. My! won&#8217;t
that be fun? You trying not to make up faces,
and I trying not to say wrong things. I&#8217;ll tell
you. Have you got a little box anywhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I presume so. Go eat your breakfast,
child. Why?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Cause. Did you know there was heathens?&#8221;
she asked gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard so. I&#8217;ve met a few.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have? How delightful!&#8221; came the
swift exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t find it so. Why, I say?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Each of us that forgot and broke over must
put a penny, a cent, I mean, in the box. It
must be shut tight, and the cover gum-mucilaged
down. You must make a hole in the
cover with your penknife, and when you screw
up your face, just for nothing, you put a penny
in. I&#8217;ll watch and tell you. Then I&#8217;ll put
one in when I say wrong things. I&#8217;ve a lot of
money in my satchel. Mamma and Doctor
Mack each gave me some to buy things on the
way. But there wasn&#8217;t anything to buy, and
I can use it all, only for Rudanthy&#8217;s new head.
Can we go buy that to-day, Uncle Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Nobody knows when I&#8217;ll get out
again, if this weather holds. The idea of a
snowstorm like this in March. <i>In March!</i>&#8221;
angrily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;Yes, suh,&#8221; responded Peter respectfully,
since some reply seemed expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, boy. Carry my mail to the library.
Get a good heat on. Fetch that old soft shawl
I put over my foot when it&#8217;s bad, and, for
goodness sake, keep that child out of the way
and contented, somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine had gone to the window, pulled
the draperies apart, and was looking out on a
very different world from any she had ever
seen. White was every object on which her
eye rested, save the red fronts of the houses,
and even these were festooned with snowy
wreaths wherever such could find a resting
place. The scene impressed and almost frightened
her; but when, presently, it stopped
snowing, and a boy ran out from a neighboring
house, dragging a red sled through the drifts,
her spirits rose. It had been one long, long
week since she had exchanged a single word
with any child, and this was an opportunity to
be improved. She darted from the room, sped
to the hall door, which stood ajar for Lafayette&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
convenience in clearing off the steps, and
dashed outward.</p>

<p>Her feet sank deep into the cold, soft stuff,
but she didn&#8217;t even notice that, as she cried,
eagerly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Little boy! Oh, little boy! Come here
quick! I want somebody to play with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment&#8217;s pause of surprise, that a child
should issue from &#8220;old Mr. Smith&#8217;s,&#8221; and the
answer came cheerily back:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish I could; but I&#8217;m going sledding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you! I never went a-sledding
in all my&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>The sentence was never finished, for somebody
jerked her forcibly back within doors just
as a great express wagon crawled to a pause
before the entrance.</p>

<small>MEMORIES AND MELODIES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;My</span> trunk! my trunk! My darling little
blue trunk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Massa Joe says for you to go right straight
back to the library, missy. He says you done
get the pneumony, cuttin&#8217; up that way in the
snow, and you not raised in it. He says not
to let that boy in here. I&mdash;I&#8217;s sorry to disoblige
any little lady what&#8217;s a-visitin&#8217; of us,
but&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my trunk, Peter. Don&#8217;t you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, missy. But Lafayette, that&#8217;s his
business, hauling luggage. I&#8217;se the butler, I
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine retreated a few paces from the
door. She had lived in the open air, but had
never felt it pinch her nose as this did. Her
feet, also, were cold, and growing wet from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
snow which was melting on them. But Peter
was attending to that. He was wiping them
carefully with his red handkerchief, and Josephine
lifted first one, then the other, in silent
obedience to his touch. But her interest was
wholly in the trunk, which had now been deposited
in the vestibule, and from which Lafayette
was carefully removing all particles of
snow before he carried it up over the carpeted
stair.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith limped to the library door and
looked out. He had meant to send word that
the trunk should be retained at the railway
station for the present, or until he should find
out to whom Josephine had really been &#8220;consigned,&#8221;
and asked, in vexation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come already, has it? Humph! If it had
been something I wanted in a hurry, they&#8217;d
have taken their own time about delivering it.
Said they couldn&#8217;t handle goods in a storm,
and such nonsense. I don&#8217;t see, Peter, as it
need be taken upstairs. Have it put in the
storeroom, where it will be handier to get at
when she leaves.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Both Peter and Josephine heard him with
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that, Uncle Joe? That &#8216;when I
leave.&#8217; Have I&mdash;have I been so&mdash;so saucy
and forgetful that&mdash;that you can&#8217;t let me stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, child. I merely meant&mdash; There,
don&#8217;t look so distressed. You are here for the
day, anyway, because none of us can go trudging
about in such weather. I&#8217;ll telephone for&mdash; There.
No matter. It&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s all right.
Don&#8217;t, for goodness sake, cry. Anything, anything
but that. Ugh! my foot. I must get
out of this draught,&#8221; he almost yelled.</p>

<p>Josephine was very grave. She walked
quietly to Uncle Joe&#8217;s side, and clasped the
hand which did not hold a cane with both her
own.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dreadful funny, seems to me. Aren&#8217;t
we going to stay in this house all the time? I
wish&mdash;I&#8217;m sorry I spoke about the box and
the heatheny money. But if you don&#8217;t mind,
I must, I must, get into my trunk. The
key is in my satchel in my room. Mamma put
it there with the clean clothes I wore last night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
She said they would last till the trunk came;
but that as soon as ever it did I must open it
and take out a little box was in it for you.
The very, very moment. I must mind my
mamma, mustn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, child, I suppose so,&#8221; he slowly returned.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was now in his reclining chair,
with his inflamed foot stretched out in momentary
comfort. He spoke gently, rather sadly,
in fact, as he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;My child, you may open your trunk. I
will never counsel you to do anything against
your mother&#8217;s wishes. She seems to be a sensible
woman. But there has been a mistake
which I cannot understand. I am Joseph
Smith. I have lived in this house for many
years, and it is the street and number which is
written on the tag you showed me. Do you
understand me, so far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course. Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. I&#8217;m sorry to tell you that I
have no twin brother, no &#8216;sister Helen,&#8217; and
no niece anywhere in this world. I have many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
cousins whom I distrust, and who don&#8217;t like me
because I happen to be richer than they. That&#8217;s
why I live here alone, with my colored &#8216;boys.&#8217;
In short, though I am Joseph Smith, of number
1000 Bismarck Avenue, I am not this same
Joseph Smith to whom your mamma sent you.
To-morrow we will try to find this other Joseph
Smith, your mislaid uncle. Even to-day I will
send for somebody who will search for him in
my stead. Until he is found you will be safe
with me, and I shall be very happy to have you
for my guest. Do you still understand? Can
you follow what I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course,&#8221; she instantly responded.</p>

<p>But after this brief reply Josephine dropped
down upon the rug and gazed so long and so
silently into the fire that her host was impelled
to put an end to her reflections by asking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, little girl, of what are you thinking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How nice it would be to have two Uncle
Joes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. That&#8217;s quite complimentary
to me. But I&#8217;m afraid that the other one might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
prove much dearer than I. Then I should
be jealous,&#8221; he returned, smiling a little.</p>

<p>Josephine looked up brightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what that means. I had a kitten,
Spot, and a dog, Keno; and whenever I petted
Spot Keno would put his tail between his legs
and go off under the sofa and look just&mdash;mis&#8217;able.
Mamma said it was jealousy made
him do it. Would you go off under a table if
the other Uncle Joe got petted? Oh! I mean&mdash;you
know. Would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Though this was not so very lucid, Mr.
Smith appeared to comprehend her meaning.
Just then, too, a severe twinge made him contort
his features and utter a groan.</p>

<p>Josephine was on her feet and at his side
instantly, crying out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, does it hurt you so dreadful much?
Can&#8217;t I do something for it? I can bathe feet
beautiful. Bridget sprained her ankle and
mamma let me bathe it with arnica. Big
Bridget said that was what cured it so quick.
Have you got any arnica? May I bathe
it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;Would you really handle a red, unpleasant,
swollen old foot and not dislike it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I shouldn&#8217;t like it much. I didn&#8217;t
like big Bridget&#8217;s. I felt queer little feelings
all up my arm when I touched it. She said it
hurt me worse than it did her. But I&#8217;d do it.
I&#8217;d love to do it even if I didn&#8217;t like it,&#8221; she
answered bravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter, fetch the arnica. Then get a basin
of hot water,&#8221; he ordered.</p>

<p>The pain was returning with redoubled force,
and Mr. Smith shut his lips grimly. He
looked at Josephine&#8217;s plump little hands, and
felt that their touch might be very soothing;
as, indeed, it proved. For when the servant
brought the things desired, the little girl sat
down upon the hassock beside the great chair
and ministered to him, as she had done to big
Bridget. The applications were always helpful,
but the tender strokes of her small fingers
were infinitely more grateful than the similar
ministrations of the faithful, yet hard-handed,
Peter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll put it to bed, as if it were Rudanthy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Poor Rudanthy! How bad she must
feel without any face. That&#8217;s worse than having
a sore foot, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; as she heaped the
coverings over the gouty toes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Far worse. Only waxen faces are not subject
to pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose not. Now, Uncle Joe, would you
like me to sing to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you sing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course. Mamma sings beautifully. She
is the leader in our choir. My papa says
she makes him think of angels when she
sings. I don&#8217;t sing like her. Course not.
But I can do some things, if you like me
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the trunk, Josephine? Though
I really think you would better leave it packed
pretty nearly as it is, since&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Joe, I&#8217;ve been thinking about that
other uncle we&#8217;ve lost. If he isn&#8217;t nice, and
mamma will let me, I&#8217;ll stay with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not dampen her spirits by suggesting
that she would better wait for him to ask her
to stay, and merely answered:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;Well, time will show what&#8217;s best. Shall
Peter unlock that trunk?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Smith did not wish to break into anybody&#8217;s
confidence; yet, since she had spoken
of a box destined for the mislaid &#8220;Uncle Joe,&#8221;
he felt that he would be justified in examining,
at least, the outside of it.</p>

<p>Josephine went away with the old colored
man, but did not tarry long. The tin box was
very near the top of the trunk, and she was in
haste to give it to her patient, to whom she
explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what&#8217;s in it. Nothing but some
California flowers. Mamma said that you
would like them, even if they faded a little.
But she hoped they wouldn&#8217;t fade. The box
is tight, like the big one she and papa take
when they go botanizing. Mamma is making
a collection of all the flowers she can and putting
them in a big, big book. She knows their
names and all about them. Mamma knows&mdash;everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I begin to think so, too, little girl. I never
before heard of so much virtue and wisdom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
shut up in one woman. Yes, I see. The box
is addressed exactly like the tag. Still, I do
not feel I have a right to open it, for it is
sealed, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s only paper. It is to keep out the
air. The air is what spoils things like violets.
Please do open it, or let me. Mamma would
be so dreadfully disappointed if you didn&#8217;t.
Why, think! We were in that terrible hurry,
yet she took time to fix it. She hadn&#8217;t seen
you in so many years, she said, and so she
<i>must</i> send it. Please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am not the &#8216;you&#8217; she meant, you
know, Josephine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re somebody, aren&#8217;t you?
You&#8217;re my Uncle Joe, anyway, whether you&#8217;re
the regular one or not. Shall I?&#8221; and she
held the box edgewise, ready to tear the strip
of paper which fastened its edges.</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-es, I suppose so. It may lead to the
explanation of this riddle,&#8221; he assented.</p>

<p>As the little girl had said, there was nothing
whatever in the tin box except a quantity of
violets, with some of the wild blossoms that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
brighten the mesas in spring-time, and one tiny
scrap of paper, on which was written, in evident
haste</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Brother Joe</span>: Let these violets tell
you all that I would say; and, as you are good
to our little one, may God be good to you.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Helen.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no great injury done anybody
by that deed, I think. We&#8217;ll put the
note back in the box and the flowers in
water. When the mislaid Joseph arrives we&#8217;ll
restore him his property in the best shape we
can,&#8221; said Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Peter listened, surprised. His master was
almost mirthful, and that, too, even during an
attack of his dreaded malady. If this were
the effect of Josephine&#8217;s presence, he hoped
that she would remain; though he was shrewd
enough to comprehend, from Mr. Smith&#8217;s
words, that this was doubtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst I hopes about it is that that
other out-of-the-way Joe Smith turns out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
wuthless creetur&#8217; that Massa Joe won&#8217;t be trustin&#8217;
little missy with. I ain&#8217;t a-wishin&#8217; nobody no
harm, I ain&#8217;t, but I&#8217;se powerful willin&#8217; the mislaid
uncle stays lost forever. Yes, suh,&#8221; he
assured his fellow-servants.</p>

<p>The violets were in a cut-glass bowl which
Peter received no reprimand for bringing,
though it was the choicest piece in his master&#8217;s
possession, but, as the old man reasoned: &#8220;The
fittenest one for posies what had travelled in a
little gell&#8217;s trunk, all the way from Californy.&#8221;
The gouty foot had ceased to torment its
owner; the street without was utterly quiet;
the fire glowed in the grate, and its glow was
reflected in a lonely old man&#8217;s heart as on the
happy face of a little girl who nestled beside
him. He remembered her statement that she
could sing, but he had been musical in his own
day and shrank from discord. Could a child
so young make real melody? He doubted it,
yet it was now his intention to make her as
happy as it lay in his power to do, for the brief
while that he might keep her; and he recalled
her mother&#8217;s written words:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;As you are good to our little one, may God
be good to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he forced himself to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want to sing now, Josephine, I will
listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t a very gracious request, but the
other did not notice that. The sight of the
home flowers had brought back a crowd of
happy memories, and without delay she began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Maxwelton braes are bonny,</div>
<div class="verse">Where early fa&#8217;s the dew,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>and had not proceeded thus far before the old
Virginian had raised himself upright in his chair
and was listening with all his keenly-critical
ears to the sweetest music he had ever heard.</p>

<p>Josephine sang for love of singing. She
could no more help it than a bird could, for
song came to her as naturally as to it. Her
voice was birdlike, too, in its clearness and
compass, and true in every note.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like that song, Uncle Joe?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like it? It&#8217;s wonderful. Child, who
trained you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;I&mdash;why, I&#8217;ve just sung with mamma;
though papa says that when I am older, if he
is able, I shall have other teachers. I don&#8217;t
think anybody can be better than mamma,
though,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something else, little girl,&#8221; came the
prompt request.</p>

<p>It was as pure enjoyment to her as to him.
She sang whatever came to her mind, and
many old ballads suggested by himself. With
each one he grew more enthusiastic, and finally
called Peter to bring him his flute.</p>

<p>By this time that bewildered creature was
prepared for anything. When he and Massa
Joe had been young, music and the flute had been
their mutual delight. But it was years and years
since that ancient instrument had been breathed
upon, though it always lay, wrapped in its
swaddling clothes, convenient to its owner&#8217;s
desk. Alas, when it was brought, it uttered
but the ghosts of former melodies, yet nobody
in that small company was the sadder for that.
The unusual sounds stole through the house,
bewitched Lafayette from his cleaning and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Apollo from his range. Open-eyed, they
stood without the library door and wasted their
time, with none to reprove; because, for once,
the sharp eyes of the major-domo, Peter, were
bent upon a more delectable sight.</p>

<p>Into the midst of this happy scene came the
discordant ring of the electric bell, and instantly
all other sounds ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who in the world would trespass upon us,
on such a day as this!&#8221; cried Mr. Smith, at
last arousing from the unusual mood into which
he had been betrayed by Josephine&#8217;s sweet
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s company, Uncle Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No company comes here without invitation,
child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came, didn&#8217;t I? But we didn&#8217;t know
that, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Business, I suppose. Always business;
and to-day I&#8217;m unfitted for all business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Business, indeed. For there was ushered
into the room, by the frowning Peter, the man
whom of all others his master now least wished
to see.</p>

<small>THE BOY FROM NEXT DOOR.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> unwelcome visitor was a Mr. Wakeman,
confidential clerk and business manager, under
Mr. Smith, of that gentleman&#8217;s many vast
enterprises. He was an alert young man,
rather jaunty of dress and manner, and almost
too eager to please his employer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Morning. Terrible prompt, aren&#8217;t you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always prompt, sir, if you remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger had brought an air of haste and
unrest into the quiet library, and its owner&#8217;s
comfort was at an end. He moved suddenly
and his foot began to ache afresh. Even
Josephine sat up erect and smoothed the folds
of her red frock, while she gazed upon Mr.
Wakeman&#8217;s face with the critical keenness of
childhood. On his part, he bestowed upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
her a smile intended to be sweet, yet that succeeded
in being merely patronizing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, sissy. Didn&#8217;t know you
had any grandchildren, Mr. Smith,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t. Of course,&#8221; was the retort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon. I&#8217;d forgotten, for the moment,
that you were a bachelor. I got your
telephone message,&#8221; said the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought I&#8217;d best see you personally before
conducting the inquiries,&#8221; went on the young
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unnecessary. Repeat the message you
received.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wakeman fidgetted. He realized that
he had been over-zealous, but proved his reliability
by saying: &#8220;&#8216;Find out if there&#8217;s another
Joseph Smith in town whose residence number
resembles mine.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm. Exactly. Have you done so?&#8221;
demanded the employer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. As I was explaining&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Explanations are rarely useful. Implicit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
obedience is what I require. When you have
followed my instructions bring me the results.
I&mdash;I am in no especial haste. You needn&#8217;t
come again to-day. To-morrow morning
will answer. Peter, show the gentleman
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>But for once Peter was not on hand when
wanted. Commonly, during an attack of gout,
he kept as close to his master as that exacting
person&#8217;s &#8220;own shadow.&#8221; The old man now
looked around in surprise, for not only had
Peter, but Josephine, disappeared. There
were also voices in the hall, and one of these
was unfamiliar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter! Peter!&#8221; he called, and loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Massa Joe. Here am I,&#8221; answered
the butler, reappearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s out yonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A&mdash;er&mdash;ahem!&mdash;the little boy from next
door, suh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That rough fellow? What&#8217;s he want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He, I reckon, he&#8217;s just come to call on our
Miss Josephine, suh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Smith leaned back in his chair, overcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
by astonishment, and Mr. Wakeman
quietly slipped away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send her back in here,&#8221; ordered the master
of the house.</p>

<p>The little girl came, attended by a red-headed
lad, somewhat taller than herself, with
whom she had already established a delightful
intimacy; for she held fast to his hand and
beamed upon him with the tenderest of smiles
as she cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Joe! Here&#8217;s Michael!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Well, Michael, what&#8217;s wanted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Josephine, Mr. Smith,&#8221; returned the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Michael, Josephine! How long have you
two been acquainted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About five minutes, I guess,&#8221; answered
the manly little chap, pulling a battered silver
watch from his jacket pocket. The watch was
minus a crystal and he calmly adjusted the
hands with one red little finger as he announced
the hour. &#8220;It was just eleven o&#8217;clock when I
rang the bell, and it&#8217;s six minutes past now,
Mr. Smith.&#8221; Then he shook up his timepiece,
generously held it toward Josephine and informed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
her: &#8220;It goes best when it&#8217;s hung up
sidewise. I&#8217;ve had it ever so long. &#8217;Most
six months, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve had my watch sixteen years,&#8221;
remarked Mr. Smith, displaying his own costly
chronometer, with its double dials and elegant
case. &#8220;But I should never think of using
it as you do yours. Well, what&#8217;s wanted
with Josephine?&#8221; he asked, with an abrupt
change.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to take her sledding,&#8221; explained
the visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t. She doesn&#8217;t belong to
me, and I never lend borrowed articles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The countenances of both children fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;What put it into your head to come here,
anyway?&#8221; demanded Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;She did,&#8221; answered Michael.</p>

<p>&#8220;Josephine? How could she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She saw me when I started out, before the
sidewalks were shovelled, and hollered after me.
I couldn&#8217;t stop then, &#8217;cause I was going to
meet another fellow. When I went in to get
a cracker I told my grandmother that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
was a little girl in here and she wouldn&#8217;t
believe it. She said&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>Michael paused with so much confusion that
his questioner was determined to hear just
what the lady had remarked, and ordered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go on. Never stop in the middle of
a sentence, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even if the sentence isn&#8217;t&mdash;isn&#8217;t a
very polite one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221; repeated Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;She said you were too selfish and fussy
to allow a child within your doors,&#8221; said the
boy, reluctantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see she was mistaken, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Smith. I explained it to her. I
said she must be a visitor, and grandma
thought in that case she&#8217;d be very lonely.
She sent me in to ask permission to take her
a ride around the park on my sled. We
don&#8217;t often have such nice sledding in Baltimore,
you know, Mr. Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, Uncle Joe, I was never on a sled in
all my whole life!&#8221; entreated Josephine, folding
her hands imploringly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;No, sir, that&#8217;s what she says. She&#8217;s a Californian,
from away the other side the map.
Where the oranges come from. Say, Josephine,
did you bring any oranges with you?&#8221;
inquired Michael.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not one,&#8221; said the little girl, regretfully.
&#8220;I guess there wasn&#8217;t time. Mamma and big
Bridget had so much packing to do, and Doctor
Mack prob&#8217;ly didn&#8217;t think. I wish I had. I
do wish I had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are plenty of oranges in this city,
child. I presume Peter has some now in his
pantry. You may ask him, if you like,&#8221; said
Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Peter didn&#8217;t wait for the asking, but disappeared
for a few moments, then to return with
a dish of them and place them on the table.
The eyes of both children sparkled, for it was
the finest of fruit, yet they waited until the
butler had brought them plates and napkins
before beginning their feast. This little action
pleased the fastidious old gentleman, and made
him realize that small people are less often ill-bred
than he had hitherto imagined them to be.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
He had based his opinion upon the behavior
of some other little folks whom it had been his
misfortune to meet upon cars or steamboats,
who seemed to be always munching, and utterly
careless where their crumbs or nutshells
fell. This pair was different.</p>

<p>Indeed, had the host known it, Michael had
been reared as daintily as Josephine had been.
&#8220;Company manners&#8221; were every-day manners
with him, and it was one of Mr. Smith&#8217;s beliefs
that &#8220;breeding shows more plainly at table
than anywhere else.&#8221; He watched the boy
with keenness, and it was due to his present
conduct, of which the lad himself was unconscious,
that final consent was given to Josephine&#8217;s
outing.</p>

<p>Selecting an orange the boy asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I fix it for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please,&#8221; answered the little girl.</p>

<p>Michael cut the fruit in halves, placed it on a
plate, laid a spoon beside it, and offered it to
Josephine, who received it with a quiet
&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; and began at once to take the
juice in her spoon. When each had finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
an orange they were pressed to have a second,
and the boy frankly accepted, though the girl
found more interest in this young companion
than in eating.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes a fellow terribly hungry to be out
in the snow all morning, Mr. Smith. Seems
as if I was always hungry, anyway. Grandma
says I am, but I reckon she doesn&#8217;t mind.
Oh! I forgot. Why, she sent you a note.
I never do remember things, somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither do I,&#8221; said Josephine, with ready
sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to, then. Girls ought to be a
great deal better than boys,&#8221; answered Michael.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, because. &#8217;Cause they&#8217;re girls, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Joe looked up from reading the brief,
courteous note and felt that that, added to the
boy&#8217;s own manner, made it safe for him to
entrust his guest to Michael&#8217;s care for a short
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Josephine. Mrs. Merriman,
my neighbor, whom I know but slightly, yet is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
kind to you, requests that I allow you to play
with her grandson for an hour. You may do
so. But put on your cloak and hat and overshoes,
if you have them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t, Uncle Joe. But I don&#8217;t need
them. My shoes are as thick as thick. See?
Oh, I&#8217;m so glad. I never rode on a red sled
in all my life, and now I&#8217;m going to. Once
my papa rode on sleds. He and you&mdash;I mean
that other uncle, away up in New York somewhere.
He&#8217;s seen snow as high as my head,
my papa has. I never. I never saw only the
teeniest-teeniest bit before. It&#8217;s lovely, just
lovely. If it wasn&#8217;t quite so cold. To ride
on a sled, a sled, like papa!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine was anything but quiet now. She
danced around and around the room, pausing
once and again to hug her uncle, who submitted
to the outbursts of affection with
wonderful patience, &#8220;considerin&#8217;,&#8221; as Peter
reflected.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you ride on, the other side the
map?&#8221; asked Michael, laying his hand on her
arm to stop her movements.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;Why&mdash;nothing, &#8217;xcept burros.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Them! Huh! I ride a regular
horse in the summer-time, I do. Go get
ready, if you&#8217;re going. I can&#8217;t stand here all
day. The fellows are outside now, whistling.
Don&#8217;t you hear them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I said she might go with you, because
you are&mdash;well, your grandmother&#8217;s grandson.
I didn&#8217;t say she might hob-nob with Tom, Dick
and Harry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michael fidgetted. The whistling of his
comrades had already put another aspect on
the matter. So long as there were no boys in
sight to play with, he felt that it would be some
fun to play with even a girl; especially one
who was so frank and ready as she whom he
had seen in Mr. Smith&#8217;s doorway. But now
the boys were back. They&#8217;d likely laugh and
call him &#8220;sissy&#8221; if he bothered with Josephine,
and what fellow likes to be &#8220;sissied,&#8221; I&#8217;d wish
to know!</p>

<p>Josephine felt the change in his manner, and
realized that there was need for haste, yet,
fortunately, nothing deeper than that. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
never occurred to her that she could be in anybody&#8217;s
way, and she returned to the library
very promptly, her red hat thrust coquettishly
on one side of her head, and her coat flying apart
as she ran. She was so pretty and so eager
that the red-headed boy began to feel ashamed
of himself, and remembered what his grandmother
often told him: that it was the mark of
a gentleman to be courteous to women. He
was a gentleman, of course. All his forefathers
had been, down in their ancient home
in Virginia, which seemed to be considered a
little finer portion of the United States than
could be found elsewhere. Let the boys jeer,
if they wanted to. He was in for it and
couldn&#8217;t back out. So he walked up to
Josephine who was giving Uncle Joe a parting
kiss, and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll button your coat. But put your hat
on straight. It won&#8217;t stay a minute that way,
and when I&#8217;m drawing you, I can&#8217;t stop all the
time to be picking it up. Where&#8217;s your
gloves? Forgot &#8217;em? Never mind. Here&#8217;s
my mittens. Ready? Come on, then. Good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
morning, Mr. Smith. I&#8217;ll take good care of
her and fetch her back all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seized Josephine&#8217;s hand, lifted his cap,
dropped it over his red hair, and darted from
the house.</p>

<p>A group of lads, his mates, had congregated
before the house, recognizing his sled upon the
steps, and wondering what could have sent him
into that forbidding mansion. They were
ready with questions and demands the instant
he should appear, but paused, open-mouthed,
when he did actually step out on the marble,
leading Josephine. He was not &#8220;a Virginian
and a gentleman&#8221; for nothing. Instinct guided
his first words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, boys! This is Josephine Smith,
from San Diego, California. She&#8217;s never seen
snow before, worth mentioning, and I&#8217;m going
to give her a sleighride. Her first one.
S&#8217;pose we make it a four-in-hand, and something
worth while? What say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will she be afraid?&#8221; asked one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a &#8217;fraid-cat, Josephine?&#8221; demanded
Michael, sternly, in a don&#8217;t-you-dare-to-say-you-are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
kind of voice, and the little Californian
rose to the occasion gallantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not. I&#8217;m not afraid of anything
or anybody&mdash;here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ropes were unhitched from another sled and
tied to lengthen that on Michael&#8217;s, while he
and another carefully placed the little passenger
upon the &#8220;Firefly,&#8221; bade her &#8220;Hold on tight!&#8221;
and shouted: &#8220;Off we are! Let her go, boys,
let her go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then began not one hour, but two, of the
wildest sport the old square had ever witnessed.
The walks traversing it had already been
cleared of the snow, but for once there was no
restricting &#8220;Keep off the grass&#8221; visible.</p>

<p>The park was like a great, snowy meadow,
across which the four lads darted and pranced,
at the risk of many upsets, their own and
Josephine&#8217;s, who accepted the plunges into the
banks of snow heaped beside the paths with
the same delight she brought to the smoother
passages, where the sled fairly flew behind its
hilarious &#8220;four-in-hands.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>Pedestrians crossing the square were gayly
informed that this was &#8220;a girl who&#8217;d never seen
snow before, and we&#8217;re giving her enough of it
to remember!&#8221; Michael was leader, as always,
and he led them a merry round, shouting his
orders till he was hoarse, losing his cap and
forgetting to pick it up, his red head always to
the fore, and his own enjoyment intense.</p>

<p>As for Josephine&mdash;words fail to express
what those two hours were to her. The
excitement of her new friends was mild compared
to her own. The snow sparkling in the
sunlight, the keen frosty air, the utter enchanting
newness of the scene, convinced her
that she had entered fairyland. Her hat
slipped back and hung behind her head, her
curls streamed on the wind, her eyes gleamed,
her cheeks grew rosy, and her breath came
faster and faster, till at last it seemed that
she could only gasp.</p>

<p>Just then appeared old Peter, holding up a
warning hand, since a warning voice would
not be heard. The four human ponies came to
a reluctant pause, stamping their feet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
jerking their heads after the approved manner
of high-bred horses, impatient of the bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the land sakes, honey! You done get
your death! You&#8217;se been out here a right
smart longer&#8217;n Massa Joe told you might.
You come right home with me, little missy,
now, if you please,&#8221; said the butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll draw her there, Peter. Why, I
didn&#8217;t know we&#8217;d been so long,&#8221; apologized
Michael.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought you was a young gentleman what
carried a watch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I am, old Peter,&#8221; then producing that
valuable timepiece he turned it on its side,
studied its face, and informed his mates:
&#8220;Half-past one, fellows, and my grandmother
has lunch at one! Whew! Home&#8217;s the
word!&#8221;</p>

<small>AFTER THE FROLIC.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Reaction</span> followed excitement. Josephine
had never been so tired, no, not even during
her long railway journey. She had laughed
and shouted till her throat ached; her eyes
were still dazzled by the gleam of sunlight
upon snow; and her clothing was wet through.
She stepped from the &#8220;Firefly&#8221; and climbed
the cold marble stoop, holding on to Peter&#8217;s
hand as if without its aid she could not have
mounted it at all. She allowed him to take off
her hat and cloak, without protesting that she
liked to do things for herself, and sat down by
the register with a shiver of content.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tired, little missy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Terrible tired, Peter, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Massa Joe&#8217;s takin&#8217; his luncheon, Miss
Josephine.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>&#8220;Is he?&#8221; she asked indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon you better come get yours. Massa
Joe don&#8217;t wait for nobody, he don&#8217;t. Less&#8217;n
ever when he&#8217;s got the gout on. Better
hurry, maybe, honey,&#8221; urged the butler.</p>

<p>Josephine rose, observed that she must go
wash her hands and fix her hair before she
could go to table, and wearily ascended the
stairs to her own grand room. Once there the
bed looked so inviting, despite its great size,
that she climbed upon it and dropped her hot
face on the cool pillow. She forgot to remove
her wet shoes, nor thought how her dampened
clothing might stain the delicate lace spread.
She meant to stay there for a moment only,
&#8220;Just till my eyes get right,&#8221; but she fell
asleep almost instantly.</p>

<p>She did not notice that the window was open,
nor that the heat had been turned off, the better
to warm the library below. She noticed nothing,
in fact, till some time later when old Peter
shook her sharply, exclaiming still more indignantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;For land, honey, don&#8217;t you know no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
better&#8217;n go sleepin&#8217; with your window open
right here in March? &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t your fault,
missy, if you don&#8217;t done ketch the pneumony.
Massa Joe says for you to come downstairs.
Little gells what live to his house must learn
not to keep table waitin&#8217;, less&#8217;n they can&#8217;t
stay. Better get up, Miss Josephine.&#8221;</p>

<p>She obeyed him, but shivered afresh as she
did so. The next moment she was so warm
she ran to the window and thrust her head out
of it. Peter drew her back and closed the
sash with a bang. Then he led her to the
washstand and made a futile attempt to brush
her tangled curls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, good Peter. I can do it.
I&#8217;m sorry I went to sleep. Has Uncle Joe
wanted me?&#8221; she interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon he has, honey. He done suffer
terrible. He like to hear you sing them songs
again, likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I will, if I&#8217;m not too tired,&#8221; she
answered.</p>

<p>The butler looked at her anxiously. Was
she going to be sick? If she were, whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
could he do with her? A sick man&mdash;that was
one thing; but a sick little girl, that was quite
another matter. She would have to go, he
feared, and to lose her now would seem very
hard.</p>

<p>After all, she did not appear ill. She
laughed and apologized so sweetly to her
would-be-angry host that he forgot his indignation
and forgave her on the spot. Only
warned her gravely that he was a man who
meant exactly what he said, and intended anybody
belonging to him should do the same.
One hour was never two; and, in case they
never came across that missing uncle of hers,
he supposed she would have to stay where she
was until such time as her own parents could
claim her; ending his lecture with the question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Would she remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>She&#8217;d promise to try and remember; and
would he like to hear all about what a lovely,
lovely time she had had? Did he know what
snow felt like? Had he ever ridden and ridden
till he couldn&#8217;t see, and been dumped into
high banks and buried underneath the soft, cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
stuff, till he was nearly smothered, and got his
stockings all wet, and shouted till he couldn&#8217;t
shout another shout? Had he? she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I have. Many, many years ago.
But wet stockings? Have you got such on
your little feet?&#8221; he anxiously asked.</p>

<p>Then, though he shrank from contact with
anything damp or cold, fearing fresh pangs to
himself, he drew off her shoe and felt the moist
but now hot, little foot within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Child, you&#8217;re crazy. Never go round like
that. Run up to your bathroom and take a
hot bath. Then put on everything clean and
dry. Don&#8217;t you know better than to behave
as you have done? Didn&#8217;t your mother have
sense&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>There he paused, arrested by the piteous
look which came over his guest&#8217;s bonny face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. Don&#8217;t cry. I couldn&#8217;t stand
that. It&#8217;s bad enough to have the gout, and a
little girl in the house who doesn&#8217;t&mdash;won&#8217;t&mdash;hasn&#8217;t
changed her stocking&mdash;Oh! Ouch!
Clear out, can&#8217;t you? My foot, my foot!&#8221;
he shouted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>Josephine might have echoed, &#8220;My throat!
my throat!&#8221; but she disdained any such outcry.
Her lip curled in a fine scorn, and at
sight of the grimace he made she laughed outright.
Laughed foolishly, convulsively, began
to cry, and with a little wail of &#8220;Mamma!
Mamma!&#8221; ran out of the room.</p>

<p>Old Peter followed, saw that her room was
made warm, prepared her bath, helped her to
lay out clean, dry clothing, and left her, with
the consoling remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you never mind Massa Joe when he&#8217;s
gouty. Men-folks ain&#8217;t done got the gumption
little gells has to keep their mouth shut and not
groan. Groanin&#8217; lets a powerful lot of bad
temper outen gouty people, missy, and don&#8217;t
you mind, honey. Just you call on me for
what you&#8217;se needin&#8217; and everything will all
come right. Now fix yourself up pretty and
come laughin&#8217; down the stairs, like you done
last night, and see what&#8217;ll happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine was comforted. The hot bath did
make her feel all right, and the pretty frock
she had selected reminded her quite happily of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
mamma and the days when she had sat sewing
upon it. The very tucks in its skirt seemed
to bring that dear presence nearer, and she reflected
that they were absent from each other
only till such time as poor papa should get
quite well. She appeared below, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m good, Uncle Joe. Forgive me
for being bad. I&#8217;ll sing again if you want
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I want you. Maybe I was a
bit stern, too, little lady. I hope this wretched
pain will leave me by to-morrow, then I&#8217;ll be
able to think of something else besides that
hateful foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor foot!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now sing, if you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josephine tried, but it was altogether
another sort of voice which essayed &#8220;Old Lang
Syne&#8221; from that which had warbled it so
sweetly earlier in the day; so that she was
promptly bidden to give over the attempt, Mr.
Smith adding:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as hoarse as a raven. A few more
such rough plays with a parcel of boys and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
your voice would be ruined. Then your
mother would never forgive me. I know
enough about music to realize what your singing
is to her. Here. Take a book and read.
By-and-by it will be dinner time. Maybe
the hot soup will soothe your throat.&#8221;</p>

<p>He directed her to a bookcase and a vellum-bound
copy of &#8220;The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress;&#8221; observing
with fresh pleasure that it was her
habit, not an accident of the previous evening,
that she handled all books daintily and with
respect for them. Then he forgot her in his
own Review, and his foot grew easier as the
afternoon wore on.</p>

<p>Josephine sat patiently poring over the familiar
story, which she could easily read in her
own copy at home, but that seemed different in
this grand volume; and after a time the words
began to mix themselves up in a curious sort of
jumble. She closed her eyes the better to
clear her vision, didn&#8217;t think to open them
again, and her head sank down upon the
pictured page.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said Mr. Smith, at last laying aside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
his own magazine, and regarding the sleeper
across the table with some amusement. &#8220;Old
Bunyan&#8217;s a trifle heavy for that pretty head.
I must hunt up some lighter stuff. Grimm or
Andersen, if I&#8217;ve such books in the library.
If not, I&#8217;ll send out after them. How lovely
and innocent she looks, and how red her cheeks
are. Her whole face is red, even, and&mdash; Peter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Massa Joe. Yes, suh,&#8221; answered the
butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that child seem a bit feverish?
Do you know anything about children, Peter?&#8221;
asked &#8220;Uncle Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mighty little, I&#8217;se afraid, suh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sleep can&#8217;t hurt anybody. Carry
her upstairs and lay her on her bed. Cover
her warm, and probably she&#8217;ll be all right
afterward. She mustn&#8217;t get sick. She must
not <i>dare</i> to get sick on my hands, Peter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Massa Joe. No, suh. She dastn&#8217;t,&#8221;
said the negro, quickly.</p>

<p>Peter lifted the little girl as tenderly as a
woman, and carried her off to rest. She did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
not rouse at all, but her head dropped heavily
on the pillow as if her neck were too slender
to support it, and her breath came with a
strange whistling sound.</p>

<p>The old negro laid his hand upon her temples
and found them hot. Though he knew
little about children, he did know that cold
water was good in such a case, so dipped a
towel and folded it across her head. The application
seemed to soothe her, for her features
became more natural, and, after a time, as she
appeared to be resting well enough, he stole
cautiously from the room and went about his
business. Though his interest was now wholly
with Josephine, he dared not neglect his duties
below stairs, and knew that, as usual when he
was ill, Mr. Smith would expect the best of
dinners that evening. It had been so stormy
early in the day that he had not attended to his
marketing, and must now make haste to repair
the delay. Apollo was apt to lay the blame
on the butler, if things failed to turn out as
desired, and there was need for haste if the
roast beef were to be secured of the cut preferred.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just fetch a posy for the little lady, I
will. If market&#8217;s over they&#8217;s plenty them
flower-stores, and maybe it&#8217;ll make her forget
all her lonesomeness. Poor little missy!
What the Lord done sent to bless this great,
empty house. Nothing mustn&#8217;t happen to
hurt her, nothing mustn&#8217;t. No, suh,&#8221; reflected
the good old man.</p>

<p>When Peter returned from his marketing
Josephine was still asleep. He did not disturb
her, though he listened anxiously to her
hoarse breathing and carefully replaced the
damp towel which her restlessness had tossed
aside. He also laid the bunch of carnations
on the coverlet beside her and cautiously
retreated to the hall, where he kept as close
a watch upon her as he could find time to
give.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner is served, Massa Joe,&#8221; he announced,
when its hour arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Miss Josephine ready?&#8221; asked the host.</p>

<p>&#8220;She done sleepin&#8217; mighty comf&#8217;table, suh,&#8221;
protested Peter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me I&#8217;ve read somewhere that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
children should sleep half the time. Is that
so, Peter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, suh, I reckon likely &#8217;tis,&#8221; replied
the other, willing to agree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t wake her. You&mdash;you may
have a little dinner put back for her,&#8221; said
&#8220;Uncle Joe,&#8221; with some hesitation.</p>

<p>The butler stared at this unheard-of condescension,
but answered after his common formula.
Yet the plate of food he so carefully
prepared and set in the hot-water dish to keep
warm for her was destined never to be eaten.</p>

<small>NEIGHBORLY AMENITIES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Merriman&#8217;s</span> bell rang violently once,
twice, and the lady laid aside her book,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can that be, so late as this? Half-past
nine, and almost bedtime. Run, Michael.
Though I thought you&#8217;d gone upstairs before
now. It takes the maid so long to answer.
There it is again. Hurry. Dear, dear! I
<i>hope</i> it isn&#8217;t a telegram.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going, Mary,&#8221; called the lad to the
maid, as he rushed to the door.</p>

<p>Peter stood outside, bareheaded and looking
almost white in his terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;For mercy&#8217;s sake, Massa Michael, is there
a woman in this house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Lots of them. Grandmother,
Mary, waitress, Samanda&mdash;Why?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>&#8220;Our little Miss Josephine. I reckon she&#8217;ll
die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Die, Peter? That little girl? What&#8217;s
the matter?&#8221; cried Michael.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness knows, I don&#8217;t. She can&#8217;t hardly
breathe, she can&#8217;t. Massa Joe&#8217;s sent for
his doctor and his doctor he&#8217;s out, and we
don&#8217;t have no faith in them others round the
square, and&mdash;<i>Will</i> some of your women please
just step in and take a look at our poor little
missy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Michael darted back into the sitting-room,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandma, that little girl next door is awful
sick. Peter&#8217;s frightened most to death himself.
He wants some of our women to go in
there and help them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our women! Of what use would they be,
either of them? I&#8217;ll go myself. Ring for
Mary, please,&#8221; said the old lady, rising.</p>

<p>The maid appeared, and was directed to
bring:</p>

<p>&#8220;My shawl and scarf, Mary. I&#8217;m going in
next door to see a sick child. You stay right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
here in the hall and keep the latch up, so that
there&#8217;ll be no delay if I send in for you or anything
needed. Yes, Michael, you may go with
me to help me up and down the steps, though
you ought to be in bed. Yet come. It must
be something serious for Mr. Smith to thus far
forego his reserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Joe was waiting at the head of the
stairs as Mrs. Merriman ascended them, with
that activity upon which she prided herself,
and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you in trouble, neighbor? What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The little girl. I don&#8217;t know whose even.
Came to me, an express &#8216;parcel,&#8217; and I haven&#8217;t
traced the blunder, found the right&mdash;no matter.
This way, please. I&#8217;ll explain later.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no trace of the gout left in the gentleman&#8217;s
movements as he preceded his neighbor
to Josephine&#8217;s room, where the child lay gasping,
feverish, and clutching at her own throat
in an agony of terror.</p>

<p>One glance, and Mrs. Merriman&#8217;s shawl was
tossed aside, and she had lifted the little sufferer
in her arms, observing:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;Not even undressed! How long has she
been like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For several hours, Peter says, but growing
steadily worse. I&#8217;ve sent for the doctor, but
he hasn&#8217;t come. He&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>She interrupted him with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Send for another. The nearest possible.
It&#8217;s croup. Short and quick, usually. Michael,
run in for Mary. Now, Peter, heat some
blankets. Find me her night-clothes. Warm
that bed. A foot-tub of hot water. Any oil
in the house? Epicac? Any other household
remedies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the medicine for the gout, madam,&#8221;
suggested Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bother the gout. That&#8217;s nothing.
<i>This</i> is&mdash;serious. There, Mary, lend a hand.
Michael, run for Doctor Wilson. Hurry. If
you can&#8217;t find him, then the next one. There
are seven of them around this square, perched
like vultures, seeking whom they may devour.
As a rule, I ignore the whole crowd, but I&#8217;m
thinking of this little one&#8217;s mother now.
Hurry, lad,&#8221; directed Mrs. Merriman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Mr. Smith stood silent, helpless, and admiring.
This was a gentlewoman of the old
school, such as he remembered his own mother
to have been, who was not afraid to use her
own hands in ministering to the suffering and
who wasted no time in questions. Every
movement of her wrinkled but still firm fingers
meant some solace to the little child, whose
brown eyes roamed from one to another with
a silent, pitiful appeal. In a twinkling, it
seemed, Josephine was undressed, reclothed
in soft, warm garments, her chest anointed with
the relaxing oil, and a swallow of hot milk
forced between her lips. Then Michael was
dispatched to the nearest drug store and
brought back a dose of the old-fashioned remedy
Mrs. Merriman had used for her own little
children. But she had hardly time to administer
it before one of the physicians summoned
had appeared, and to him she promptly resigned
the direction of affairs. His first order
was that Mr. Smith should go below to his
own comfortable library and remain quiet,
adding:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll report as soon as your child is better,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t my child, doctor, but do you
care for her as if she were. Spare no expense.
She must not, she must not die upon my
hands. I&#8217;d no right to retain her as long as
I have, but&mdash;but&mdash; Don&#8217;t let her die, doctor,
and you&#8217;ll save me from everlasting remorse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go below, Mr. Smith. Peter, attend
your master. There are enough of us here,
and this little lady will soon be all right. It&#8217;s
croup only, and&mdash; What has she been eating
lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has she not? How can I tell? But
one thing I know, she ate no dinner to-night,&#8221;
answered the host.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better. Now, Mr. Smith&#8221;&mdash;a
wave of the hand in the direction of the
doorway suggested that the master of the
house was banished from the sickroom.</p>

<p>Daylight was breaking when at last the
doctor led Mrs. Merriman down the stairs and
to her own home, leaving Mary and Peter on
watch, and promising a speedy return, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
the assurance that all danger was now past.
At the door of the library the old lady paused
and looked in. Mr. Smith still sat erect in his
chair, and seemed as wide awake as she was
drowsy, and she advised him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to bed, neighbor. The little one is all
right again. We&#8217;ve had a tussle for it, but
she&#8217;s pulled through. Go to bed and get some
rest. I&#8217;m really sorry for you that this uninvited
trouble has come upon you, and will help
you share it, so far as I may. But, doubtless,
we&#8217;ll all see why it was allowed, before we&#8217;ve
done with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned, gallantly enough:</p>

<p>&#8220;For one reason, it may be, madam, to
render me more just and tolerant to my neighbors.
You have laid me under great&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>But she checked him, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, under nothing at all. It was
the little child for whom I came, and if I have
served you, too, why so much the better.
Good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went at once, leaving him to reflect:</p>

<p>&#8220;To go to bed at daylight! When ever did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
I such a thing? But I will. Though I wonder
if I am quite right in my mind. The idea of
one small child upsetting two such households,
all for the sake of a sled-ride! Hmm. Hmm.
Peter! Here, Peter. I&#8217;m for bed at breakfast
time! After an hour or two of rest I&#8217;ll
set about finding that mislaid Joseph Smith
and hand over to him this little-too-absorbing
responsibility. Thank God, boy, that she did
not die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, Massa Joe. I&#8217;se been a-thinkin&#8217; of
him the whole endurin&#8217; night. Powerful
queer, ain&#8217;t it? Just such a little speck of
while, and now seems if that little missy worth
more to old Peter than the whole universe.
Yes, suh, the whole universe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much you know about the universe, boy.
There, there! Take care that foot. If you
set it aching again&mdash;Ouch!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not one but many hours that Mr.
Smith slept, worn out by his late physical
suffering and his anxiety of the last night.
When he woke his first inquiry was for Josephine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>&#8220;Laws, Massa Joe, it&#8217;s just wonderful. That
child seems if nothing ever ailed her. The
doctor done been here again and told what to
give her for breakfast. She eat it like she was
&#8217;most starved, the little lamb. Now she&#8217;s
sleepin&#8217; again, the beautifullest ever was. I
&#8217;xpect &#8217;twas that sleddin&#8217; round the square
done fetched it on. Next time&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, boy. Don&#8217;t count on any &#8216;next
time&#8217; for her here. I must hunt up that other
Joseph Smith and hand her over to him forthwith,&#8221;
said the master.</p>

<p>Peter&#8217;s heart sank. How could they ever
endure that great house now with this little
child gone out of it? Well, there was one
thing which nobody could prevent&mdash;his wishing
that the &#8220;other Joseph&#8221; might never be found!</p>

<p>After Mr. Smith had eaten he paid a flying
visit to the little one&#8217;s room, gazed at her now
peaceful, if pale face, and stole downstairs
again with softened tread. He limped but
slightly, and made a critical survey of himself
before he issued from the great hall into the
street.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;If you&#8217;s going down town, Massa Joe, like
enough you better have a cab. &#8217;Counten your
foot,&#8221; suggested Peter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may &#8217;phone for one, boy. No. Stay.
I&#8217;ll not baby myself thus far. The air is warm
as summer, almost, and the streets cleared.
I&#8217;ll take a car; but&mdash;Shut that door, Peter.
I don&#8217;t need you further. If anything happens
to Miss Josephine, or any news comes concerning
her, send me word at once. Shut that
door, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; he finished testily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, suh;&#8221; yet good Peter left it a
crack ajar, the better to watch his master,
whose actions somehow suggested a different
order of things from usual. He saw Mr.
Smith descend his own and ascend Mrs. Merriman&#8217;s
stoop, and threw up his hands in dismay,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;For goodness! I do hope Massa Joe ain&#8217;t
done gone rake up all that old line-fence
trouble, just after her bein&#8217; so good to our
little missy. What if &#8217;tis five inches on our
ground, and she claimin&#8217; it&#8217;s just so far &#8217;tother
way, and the lawyers argifying the money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
outen both their pockets, this ain&#8217;t no time for
to go hatchin&#8217; fresh miseries. And I never,
not once, all these dozen years seen Massa
Joe go a callin&#8217; and a visitin&#8217; nobody, not for
just pure visit. Whenever he has, &#8217;twas
&#8217;cause there was some sort of business tacked
on to the end of it somehow. Huh! I never
done looked for this, I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither had the lady expected the call which
was made upon her. But she greeted her
guest with a friendly courtesy that made him
all the more remorseful for the legal difficulties
he had placed in her way in the past, and
quite ready to offer his apologies for the same
at a fitting opportunity. At present his visit
was to express his gratitude for her services to
Josephine, and to ask her advice.</p>

<p>&#8220;My advice, Mr. Smith? I am the last person
in the world to advise so capable a person
as yourself. My opinion you&#8217;re most welcome
to, if you explain what I should express
it about,&#8221; she returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;The little girl, Josephine;&#8221; and he told all
he knew and had thought concerning her; finishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
with the words, &#8220;I have so little information
to go upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>She promptly inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, but have you gone upon what
little you do possess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, have you really set about finding
this mislaid uncle as if your heart was in it?&#8221;
she explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t hurried. I deputized my business
man to look the thing up, but&mdash;I don&#8217;t
deny that I wish the other rightful Joseph
Smith might be found to have left the country,&#8221;
he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even despite the anxiety Josephine has
caused you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madam. I mean to be honest. I
hate to set detectives on the task, yet I will.
But meanwhile, until the child&#8217;s relatives are
found, what shall I do with her? Can you
direct me to a capable woman who will engage
to look after her welfare for the few days I
may need her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Merriman looked at him critically,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
with a twinkle gleaming in her eye. An audacious
thought had come to her, yet a thought
so full of possibilities for good&mdash;and, maybe,
ill&mdash;that she decided to act upon it, and
quietly replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Smith, I think I do know just
the right woman. She has lately returned
from a winter in California, where she has
been nursing an invalid back to health.
She is a trained nurse and was with me last
year, during my long illness. I received her
card recently saying that she would be in
this city about now. Indeed, she must have
left Southern California at about the same
time as your little ward, though she was to
delay a day or so at Chicago. I will send to
inquire if she is at home, at her boarding-house,
if you desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>He assented, adding:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be very grateful. I trust I may
be able to prove later on that I am not unappreciative
of all your goodness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it. Good morning. I will
write the note immediately, and until some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
person is regularly established in your house
to look after little Josephine, I will step in
there now and then, myself, to see that all is
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>They parted most amicably, and the first
action of Mr. Smith, upon reaching his office,
was to send for his lawyer and tell him that he
had abandoned the question of line-fences
entirely; that Mrs. Merriman should be notified
that all claim to the &#8220;insignificant strip of
land midway their respective side-yards was
hereby and forever relinquished, with no costs
to herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her own proceeding was the writing of a
note to her friend, the nurse, and so imperative
was the summons it contained that the
lady answered in person, although not yet sufficiently
rested from the fatigue of a long
journey and her previous engagement to desire
another so promptly.</p>

<p>As for Josephine, after a morning of dreamless,
health-restoring sleep, she woke to find a
familiar figure sitting by her bedside, smiling
affectionately upon her. A brief, puzzled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
glance, a rubbing of the brown eyes to make
sure they saw aright, and the child sprang out
of bed, into the woman&#8217;s arms crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Red Kimono! You dear, kind, Mrs.
Red Kimono, where did you come from?&#8221;</p>

<small>TOM, DICK, HARRY, AND THE BABY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the next week Mr. Smith was untiring
in his efforts to find the missing Joseph Smith,
his namesake. Telegrams sped back and forth
between Baltimore and San Diego, with the
result that the only information gained was: on
the very day, or the next following that, on
which Mrs. John Smith sailed from San Diego
for Santiago de Chile, Doctor Alexander MacDonald,
otherwise known as &#8220;Doctor Mack,&#8221;
had departed for the Philippines. No person
at their recent home knew anything further
concerning these two persons, and owing to
their long journeys all communication with
them was for the present impossible.</p>

<p>The seventy-five Joseph Smiths residing in
or around Baltimore had all been unearthed,
so to speak, without finding one who in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
particular beyond the name resembled the desired
one. Not one was anybody&#8217;s twin, not
one happened to have had any relative in either
San Diego or Santiago, and not one welcomed
the thought of receiving a strange child into
his household.</p>

<p>One Joseph Smith had, indeed, been found
to have lately resided at 1000 Bismarck Street
and this confusion of street and avenue explained
to Uncle Joe&#8217;s mind the whole curious,
yet simple blunder. This Bismarck-Street
Joseph Smith was, doubtless, the right one;
but, also, he was the only one of the seventy-five
who could not now be located! He had
disappeared as completely as if the earth had
swallowed him, and Josephine&#8217;s present guardian
rested his efforts; merely causing an
advertisement to be inserted in each of the
daily papers to the effect that the person answering
it might hear of something to his
advantage by calling at the newspaper office
and leaving his address for the advertiser, &#8220;S.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody called. Matters dropped into a
comfortable routine. Uncle Joe was disturbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
at finding the name of the trained nurse was
also Smith, and to prevent unpleasant complications,
requested that he might call her as the
little girl did, &#8220;Mrs. Red Kimono,&#8221; or, more
briefly, &#8220;Miss Kimono,&#8221; she having set him
right as to her maidenly condition.</p>

<p>She readily and smilingly agreed to this,
and, reporting the matter to Mrs. Merriman,
laughed so heartily over it, that that lady remonstrated,
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Miss Desire, it&#8217;s outrageous. Under
the circumstances I would never permit it.
The idea! He excludes you from table with
himself and the little girl, does he not? For
so Michael tells me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Not, I fancy, from arrogance, but
merely from force of habit. He dislikes
women, utterly and sincerely. Or he thinks
he does. But Josephine has won his whole
heart for childhood, and he likes her to be
with him as constantly as possible. From
what the servants tell me, she has wrought a
complete transformation in the household.
And she is so lovely, so winning, that eventually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
she&#8217;ll bring everything right. I don&#8217;t
mind the table business; the main thing is
that I am in his house, tolerated there, and
determined, if the time is not too short, to
prove to him that blood is thicker than water,
and that, just though he thinks himself, he has
been wholly unjust in his treatment of others.
Oh, I don&#8217;t object to the situation. I get lots
of quiet fun out of it, and haven&#8217;t felt so
happy in a long time. I&#8217;ve even lost all bitterness
against him, poor, solitary, prejudice-bound
old man,&#8221; returned the nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, may I be there to see when the
revelation is at last made! Though I prophesy
that his behavior in the matter will be as
straightforward as it was about the line-fence.
Think! We squabbled over it like a couple of
silly children, for years and years. I can&#8217;t
understand now how I could ever have been so
absurd. Must you go? Well, then, since
your employer wishes you to take little Josephine
down town to get that Rudanthy a head,
suppose you both go with me in my carriage?
I will call for you at three o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>Miss Kimono thanked her friend and departed;
and that same afternoon the unhappy
doll&#8217;s ruined countenance was replaced by one
so beautiful that it almost consoled Josephine
for the loss of the more familiar face.</p>

<p>That very day, too, away out in a suburban
village, where rents were cheap and needs few,
three little lads sat on a bare floor, surrounding
a baby, who rejoiced in the high-sounding
name of Penelope, but rejoiced in very little
else. Even now she was crying for her dinner,
and each of the &#8220;triplets,&#8221; as they were called
by the neighbors, was doing his utmost to console
her. In reality they were not triplets,
though the eldest were twins, and their names
were those so objectionable in Uncle Joe&#8217;s
ears, Tom, Dick, and Harry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Penel! You may play with my pin-wheel!&#8221;
cried the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Harry, she must not. She&#8217;ll swallow
it. The pin&#8217;ll scratch her insides. She swallows
everything, Penelope does. And you
mustn&#8217;t say just &#8216;Penel.&#8217; Mother doesn&#8217;t
like that. She says it&#8217;s a beautiful name and
mustn&#8217;t be spoiled.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;Oh, Tom, you&#8217;re always a c&#8217;recting a
fellow. Well, if she can&#8217;t have my pin-wheel,
what shall I give her to make her shut up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I can find something in mother&#8217;s
cupboard, maybe,&#8221; answered Harry.</p>

<p>The tone was doubtful, but the suggestion
cheering, and with one accord the triplets left
the baby to its fate and betook themselves to
the rear room where they ransacked a small
pantry, only to find their search rewarded by
nothing more palatable than a stale loaf of
bread and a few raw potatoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t eat taters, and she can&#8217;t eat this
bread, &#8217;ithout it&#8217;s softened. And there isn&#8217;t
any milk,&#8221; said Dick, despondingly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see why we don&#8217;t have things like we used to
have. I don&#8217;t know what made my folks
move &#8217;way out here to nowhere, anyway. I
was just going to get a new &#8217;rithmetic to my
school, and now, I&mdash;I hate this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t hate it, Dicky. Not always.
You&#8217;re hungry, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said the more
thoughtful Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so are you!&#8221; retorted Dick, resenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
the statement as if it were an implication
of guilt.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t get milk, water must do,&#8221;
answered Tom, taking the loaf from his
brother&#8217;s hand and carefully breaking off a
portion of it, to moisten it under the spigot.</p>

<p>The others watched him with keen interest,
and Harry inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you s&#8217;pose I could have just a little
bit, Tom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose anything like it. You
aren&#8217;t a baby, are you? Only babies eat
when &#8217;tisn&#8217;t dinner time, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once I used to eat when &#8217;twasn&#8217;t dinner.
Once I did,&#8221; answered the little boy, with
something like a quiver of the lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does our father or our mother eat &#8217;tween
meals, Harry Smith?&#8221; demanded Tom, indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Come on. If we can&#8217;t have bread
let&#8217;s play hop-toad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. After I&#8217;ve set Penelope up
against the wall so&#8217;s we shan&#8217;t knock her
over,&#8221; answered the brother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>The little maid was soon propped securely
across an angle of the whitewashed wall, with
a chair before her to keep her from creeping
forward into danger, and the small triplets
were soon leaping over one another&#8217;s backs,
around and around the room. Fortunately,
there was little furniture to obstruct their
movements and therefore little danger of hurting
themselves; and though the exercise
tended to increase their always-present hunger,
that was nothing new.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fellow can have a good time even if he
doesn&#8217;t have a good dinner,&#8221; was their father&#8217;s
assertion; and to them father was an oracle.</p>

<p>While the fun was at its height there came a
knock on the little street door. The house was
but the tiniest of cottages, and its floor raised
but slightly above the street. Its door hung
loosely from its upper hinge and dragged so
heavily in closing that it was commonly left
ajar. No landlord cared to fix it up for such
poor tenants as now occupied the property, and
they had not done it for him. So that when
his knock was unanswered, because unheard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the visitor calmly entered, followed the noise,
and presented himself before the gaze of the
astonished, suddenly quieted lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, youngsters, hard at it?&#8221; demanded
the stranger, playfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hop-toad, leap-frog; having frolics,&#8221; answered
Harry, boldly, while his brothers, the
twins, clung together and looked anxiously at
the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice game. Used to play it myself, when
I was a little shaver. Don&#8217;t know but I
might be persuaded to try it again, if I was
invited,&#8221; said the unknown visitor.</p>

<p>None of the trio responded to this suggestion,
nor was the game resumed. The three
children stood utterly silent, regarding the
gentleman with the intensely critical gaze of
childhood which pretence finds so disconcerting.
The stranger felt as if six gimlets were
boring their way through his outward amiability
to the vexation beneath; a vexation that
he had allowed himself to come so far out of
his way to find a man who could not possibly
reside in such a hovel. None the less, since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
here he was he would ask a question or two
for the satisfaction of it, and put the first one,
thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, youngsters, what&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, Dick, and Harry. That&#8217;s me,&#8221; answered
the latter, placing his arms akimbo, the
better to stare at the questioner, it seemed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mischief! Saucy, aren&#8217;t you!&#8221; rejoined
the newcomer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the baby. That&#8217;s Penelope,&#8221; added
Tom, with his usual precise gravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, Dick, and Harry, and the baby; a
hopeful lot of you. All right. So much for
first names, though I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re
genuine. Give us the last name and be quick
about it,&#8221; ordered this odd man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our name is Smith. That&#8217;s our father&#8217;s
name and our mother&#8217;s. Why? <i>Do they owe
you something?</i> &#8217;Cause if they do, I wish, I
wish you&#8217;d please go away, quick as a wink,
and not let them know you&#8217;ve been here. My
father can&#8217;t help it. He&mdash;something got
wrong with the business, and I&#8217;ve heard them
talk lots of times. They&#8221;&mdash;explained Tom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>Just there it occurred to the little fellow
that he was discussing family affairs too freely
with a stranger, and instinct made him pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, &#8216;they&#8217; what? Is his name Joseph?
Joseph Smith? Has he a brother who is a
twin?&#8221; asked the stranger.</p>

<p>Tom considered, there seemed no harm in
answering these questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, his name is Joseph. He has a
brother who is a twin, same as me and Dick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there ensued the following dialogue,
begun by the visitor with the next question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does this uncle of yours live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know? Haven&#8217;t you ever seen
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out looking for work. Maybe he&#8217;ll get it
to-day, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wistfulness of the childish voice told its
own story, and even Mr. Wakeman&#8217;s heart
was touched by it. He was compelled to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely he will, chappie. Likely enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
he will. And your mother? I suppose you
have a mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course. The nicest mother there is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she happen to be at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s gaze flew past the questioner toward
a little woman who had entered unperceived,
and who was closely followed by a handsome
man with a mien as bright and undaunted as
if he were not evidently half-starved and poor
in the extreme. With the gentlest of movements
he placed himself between the lady and
the stranger, as if to ward off from her any
fresh misfortune.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your errand, Mr.&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wakeman. My name is Wakeman. Since
you didn&#8217;t answer our advertisement I looked
you up, myself. I represent Joseph Smith, of
the Stock Exchange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; The ejaculation spoke volumes.</p>

hope, relief, eagerness, and gratitude. The
name was that of a well-known financier; one
who had the power of dispensing good or ill to
hundreds of other men. It could not forebode
ill to the master of this insignificant home,
since he was no debtor to it; therefore it
must denote some blessing. A situation, the
chance to earn a living for these precious ones
whom his failure and his honesty had impoverished.
For the first time, at the relief of this
fancy, tears leaped to the bright, clear eyes of
this new Joseph Smith, and unconsciously, it
seemed, he clasped his wife&#8217;s thin waist with
his strong arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer for us, Kitty, girl. Doubtless this
other Joseph Smith needs an accountant and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
has heard of my skill that way. I was an expert,
sir, before I went into business for myself
and failed, attempting a commercial line I did
not understand,&#8221; explained the man, yet losing
his own courage as the explanation went on.
He had boasted thus of his reputation the better
to comfort his wife, but he read no encouragement
in the countenance of Mr. Wakeman,
which grew more forbidding each instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not mistake, Mr. Smith. My errand is
not of the sort which you appear to expect.
My employer&mdash;I am myself an expert accountant,
and the only one necessary to our business&mdash;my
employer does not know of my
present visit. Some days ago he entrusted a
private bit of detective work to me, and I have
now, I think, brought it to a finish. Why,
however, may I ask, did you not reply to our
advertisement?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen none. This,&#8221; waving his hand
around the bare apartment, &#8220;is hardly the place
where the luxury of newspapers may be looked
for. What was the advertisement, if you
please?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>Mr. Wakeman explained. Explained, added,
itemized, and diffused himself all over the argument,
so to speak, while the faces of his
audience grew more and more tense and disturbed.
At length he finished:</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the way it stands, sir, you see.
Your brother John consigned this child to my
employer, through a mistake in the address.
Simply that. Now an old gentleman and&mdash;feeble,
I may say&#8221;&mdash; Oh! if Uncle Joe could
have heard him! &#8220;A feeble old man is not
the one to be burdened with other folks&#8217; relations.
When I go back to town, now, I&#8217;ll be
able to report that the missing uncle of this
waif has been found at last, and that&mdash;Shall
I say when you will call to reclaim her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Father and mother looked into each other&#8217;s
eyes, one questioning the other, and reading
in each but the same answer. Then said
Joseph Smith, rightful uncle of our Josephine:</p>

<p>&#8220;Spare yourself the trouble, Mr. Wakeman.
My brother&#8217;s child is our child, as dear and
near. Alas, that I can offer her no better
shelter! but it is a safe one and will be more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
comfortable. I shall soon get a situation; I
<i>must</i> soon get one. It is impossible that skill
shall go forever unrecognized. In any case the
little Josephine must come home to us. Eh,
Kitty, girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>She answered him valiantly, seeing through
his unusual boastfulness, who was commonly
so modest of his own attainments, and smiling
back upon him with the same undaunted
courage he brought to their changed life. It
was taking bread from her own children&#8217;s
mouths to do what now she did, yet her step
never faltered as she walked across to the
little cupboard and took from some hidden
nook, known only to herself, their last quarter
dollar. This she gave to her husband, saying
cheerily:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you go at once, Joe, you may be home
again in time for dinner. I&#8217;d like to be
prompt with it for I&#8217;ve secured a dress to
make for a woman in the neighborhood and
can begin it to-night. Besides, I&#8217;m all impatience
to see this little Josephine. Think of
it, dear, the child who was named for you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
How little we dreamed she was right here in
our own Baltimore all this time. Go, dear, at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>With something like a groan the man caught
the brave little creature in his arms, and was
not ashamed to kiss her then and there before
this staring stranger who had brought them
this news. Ill or good, which would it prove?
Then he put on his hat and went directly away.</p>

<p>Mr. Wakeman followed more slowly. He
did not feel as much elated over his success as
an amateur detective as he fancied he should
feel. He was thinking of many things. Suppose
this fellow, who was so down on his luck,
this other unknown, insignificant Joseph Smith,
should happen to take the fancy of the great
Joseph Smith, of whom the world of business
stood in such awe, and that magnate should
happen to employ him on certain little matters
of his own? Suppose those inquiries were
directed toward his, Mr. Wakeman&#8217;s, own accounts,
what would follow? Who could tell?
Hmm! Yes, indeed. To prevent any such
&#8220;happenings&#8221; that might prove unpleasant, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
would be as well to make a little detour around
by the office, even though it was after office
hours and business all done for that day. In
any case the new-found Uncle Joe, the real article,
was now <i>en route</i> for 1000 Bismarck Avenue,
and it wouldn&#8217;t take two to tell the same
story. Mr. Wakeman hoped the story would
be told, and that child which had caused him
so much trouble well out of the way before he
again met his master. Then would be quite
time enough to look for a reward, such as was
due from a multi-millionaire to his trusted and
effective man of affairs.</p>

<p>Pondering thus, Mr. Wakeman rode back
to town in a livery hack, while the impecunious
uncle of the little Californian rode thither in a
democratic street car. The faster the car sped
the more impatient the improvident young man
became. He wondered if his twin&#8217;s little
daughter could be half as pretty and interesting
as his own small people. He was glad he
had never once written John or Helen anything
about his business troubles. They supposed
him to be doing uncommonly well and living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
in comfort, if not in luxury. Well, if this
young Josephine were of the same good stock
as her father a little poverty and privation in
her youth wouldn&#8217;t hurt her; and where,
search the wide world over, could any child
find a sweeter, better foster-mother than his
own Kitty?</p>

<p>When he arrived at Bismarck Avenue, things
were already happening there which were out
of the ordinary, to say the least. Among the
day&#8217;s mail had come several letters to one Miss
Desire Parkinson Smith, care of Mr. Joseph
Smith. These letters had been handed to
the master along with his own, and had caused
him surprise amounting almost to consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Desire Parkinson! Desire Parkinson! And
Smith! The combination is remarkable, if
nothing more, Peter,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, suh, Massa Joe. Yes, suh,&#8221; returned
the also startled negro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see these letters?&#8221; asked the
master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the butler.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;Notice the superscription. Ever been any
others with the same?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, suh, heaps. Most all of them comes
to Miss Kimono. Though some is just plain
Miss Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm! Hmm! This is&mdash;this is&mdash;disturbing,&#8221;
admitted Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Uncle Joe dropped into deep thought and
sat so long in profound quiet that Josephine,
playing on the carpet near by, folded her
hands and watched him anxiously. She had
grown to love his stern old face, that was
never stern to her, with all the fervor of her
affectionate heart; and presently she could
not refrain from tiptoeing to him and laying
her soft fingers tentatively upon his arm. He
looked up at her, smiled, and murmured,
more to himself than to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange, strange. I&#8217;ve noticed something,
a familiar trick of manner, something
unforgotten from boyhood, Aunt Sophronia&mdash; Little
Josephine, where is your&mdash;your
nurse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the sitting-room with Mrs. Merriman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
Uncle Joe. Shall I call her?&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will, dear. I&#8217;d like to speak with
her a moment,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The ladies were deep in the intricacies of
a new lace pattern, and though Miss Kimono
rose obediently to the summons Josephine delivered,
Mrs. Merriman for once forgot the requirements
of etiquette and followed without
invitation. But Mr. Smith was now too excited
to notice this, and so it happened that one of the
old gentlewoman&#8217;s wishes was gratified without
anybody&#8217;s connivance. &#8220;May I be there
to see,&#8221; she had said, and here she was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Smith, what is your Christian name?&#8221;
demanded the master of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Desire Parkinson, Mr. Smith,&#8221; glancing
toward the letters lying on his table, replied the
nurse. They flung their brief remarks at each
other, as though they were tossing balls, thus:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span>: &#8220;That is an uncommon name, Miss&mdash;Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span>: &#8220;As uncommon, I suppose, as our
mutual surname is common.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span><span class="smcap">He</span>: &#8220;Were you named for anybody in
especial?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span>: &#8220;For a very dear lady in especial.
For my mother&#8217;s twin sister.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span>: &#8220;She was a Parkinson?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span>: &#8220;She was a Parkinson.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span>: &#8220;She married a Smith?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span>: &#8220;She married a Smith, of Virginia.
So did my mother another Smith, of another
State. The world is full of them, Mr. Smith.
We shall never be lonely because of a dearth
of our patronymic.&#8221; The lady was smiling in
great amusement, and, it is possible, the
amusement was tinctured by a spice of malice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span>: &#8220;What was your mother&#8217;s Christian
name, if I may ask?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span>: &#8220;Surely you may ask, and I will
answer to the best of my ability. Her name
was Sophronia.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span>: &#8220;Then you and I are&mdash;are&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span>: &#8220;Bear up, Mr. Smith, we are first
cousins.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span>: &#8220;You&mdash;you knew this before?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span>: &#8220;I&#8217;ve known it ever since our branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
of the family began fighting you to recover
their portion of the old family estates in&mdash;Virginia!&#8221;</p>

<p>The excitement of the moment, so long anticipated
by her and undreamed of by him, was
tinging her cheeks with a little color which
made her, for the time being, nearly as handsome
as he was and that brought out with
distinctness a strong family likeness. This resemblance
was swiftly detected by little Josephine,
who caught a hand of each exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;re just the same as one another,
my darling Kimono and my precious Uncle
Joe! We&#8217;re all folks together? We&#8217;re all the
same Smith folks together!&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon this tableau the porti&egrave;res parted, and
the dignified voice of Peter obtruded the announcement:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Joseph Smith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Utter silence for an instant, then Josephine
dropped the hands she was clasping and
bounded toward the newcomer, almost
screaming her delight:</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa! Papa! Papa!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;My little Joe! John&#8217;s one baby daughter!
My precious little namesake!&#8221;</p>

<p>The mislaid uncle had been found! That
truth was evident in the spontaneous recognition
of him, by his likeness so strong to his
twin, that even the daughter had confounded
the pair. A moment later, though, the child
had perceived her own mistake and was regarding
him more shyly, from the safe refuge
of the old Uncle Joe&#8217;s knee, which had long
since learned to adjust itself to the convenience
of small maidens.</p>

<p>Something prompted Mrs. Merriman and
Miss Kimono to withdraw from a scene they
dreaded might be painful, and they thoughtfully
took Josephine away with them. They
knew, far better than she, how wonderfully
she had grown into the lonely heart of the
aged millionaire, whose money was so powerless
to buy for him what this other, younger
Joseph was so rich in. It were kinder and
wiser to leave the two uncles alone, and face
to face to adjust their complicated affairs as
best they might.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>Nobody need have feared, though. When
folk are honest-minded, and love a common
object, such as little Josephine, matters are
soon arranged. In half an hour the conference
was over, and the child ran back into the
library to find the two Uncle Joes standing
before its window and looking across the
pretty square&mdash;where the crocuses were
peeping through the tender grass and no sign
of snow remained&mdash;toward a small house on
its sunny northeastern corner.</p>

<p>The child slipped in between the two and
caught a hand of both, while for an instant each
diverted his gaze to her sweet face and smiled
upon her. Then began again the deep, well-beloved
tones of the old Uncle Joe:</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Joseph, that&#8217;s the house. It&#8217;s
empty. I bought it on a speculation, and fitted
it up well. It&#8217;s completely furnished, and so
nicely I wouldn&#8217;t let it to every tenant who&#8217;s
applied. That will go with the position, in
addition to the salary. I&#8217;ve been dissatisfied
with Mr. Wakeman this long time. He&#8217;s too
officious, too grasping, too eager. I&#8217;m thankful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
he found you, and will pay him well for it.
But that ends his service to me. I&#8217;ll give him
an advance of wages and shake him. You can
enter upon your duties&mdash;to-morrow, if you
like. I&#8217;ll send out a van or two to move in
your effects.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new Uncle Joe held up his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unnecessary, dear Mr. Smith. Our effects
could easily be brought in on a pushcart;&#8221; yet
saying this the man&#8217;s smile was neither less
bright nor more ashamed. Why should he be
ashamed? He had gone down in one battle
with the world, but he was up again and ready
for another.</p>

<p>The answer, somehow, pleased the elder
man. He liked simplicity, and he liked frankness.
Josephine&#8217;s new uncle possessed both
these, with an added cheerfulness which communicated
itself to all who met him. He was,
or had been, as ready to take his brother&#8217;s
charge upon his hands in his penury as he
now seemed to be in his suddenly acquired
prosperity.</p>

<p>Looking across the square at the home offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
him, his eye kindled and his cheek glowed.
His figure that had stooped somewhat from
the wasted strength due insufficient food became
erect, and his whole bearing assumed a
military poise that was so fondly familiar to
the little Californian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my, Uncle Joe! My dear, sweet, new
Uncle Joe! You&#8217;re more and more like my
papa all the time. If you had on his gray,
bright-buttony soldier clothes, and his lovely
red sash, you would be a regular Company
F&mdash;er! wouldn&#8217;t you? I wish mamma was
here, and papa and Doctor Mack and funny
big Bridget!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they all shall be some day, Josephine.
But first you&#8217;ll have to get acquainted with
Tom, Dick, Harry, and Penelope, and the
sweetest Aunt Kitty that ever the sun shone
on,&#8221; he answered heartily.</p>

<p>Josephine&#8217;s brown eyes opened in astonishment,
and she said, with a deprecating look at
the old Uncle Joe:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to, if you&#8217;d like me to, but he&mdash;this
one&mdash;<i>he</i>&#8217;d not like me to. He said, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
told Michael, that lovely red-headed Michael,
that I couldn&#8217;t hob-nob&mdash;whatever that is&mdash;with
any Tom, Dick, or Harry who was in the
square. Didn&#8217;t you, Uncle Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>It pleased the old gentleman that she still
retained her familiar name for him, and he lifted
her tenderly to his breast, replying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, little lassie, I did; but that was before
I knew these were real children who were
coming to live in my house yonder. Such
boys as are brought up by this gentleman, and
your own cousins&mdash;why, of course, it&#8217;s different.&#8221;</p>

<p>From her safe place within the first uncle&#8217;s
arms, she questioned the younger man:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got all those to your house, Uncle
Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, little girl. Will you come and live
with them when we all move to that pretty
house on the corner?&#8221; he responded.</p>

<p>Her arm went around her first friend&#8217;s neck,
and he now didn&#8217;t fret in the least because it
rumpled his fresh linen, as she cuddled her
cheek against his, and asked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>&#8220;Who&#8217;ll live here with you in this big
house, first Uncle Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose my colored &#8216;boys&#8217; only;
as before you came,&#8221; was his low-toned answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody else?&#8221; she continued, in tones
equally low.</p>

<p>He sighed: &#8220;Who else could, lassie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, me! He&#8217;s got so many, and it&#8217;s
only across the square. And Red Kimono,
who&#8217;s your own cousin, you know. Shall
we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will, darling,&#8221; answered the old
man, with moistened eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then when papa and mamma come back
from that far off red-pickley country maybe
they&#8217;d be glad to stay, too. Can&#8217;t &#8217;lectrickellers
find places to earn money in this Baltimore,
Uncle Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sure that your Uncle Joe and I will
find your electrician a fine place, little one;
and we&#8217;ll call Red Kimono by her real name,
Cousin Desire, because she was my mother&#8217;s
twin sister&#8217;s child; and we&#8217;ll send for big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Bridget to wait upon this real Tom, Dick, and
Harry combination of youngsters; and&mdash;anything
you like!&#8221; he answered, so gleefully
that even Peter scarcely recognized him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you? Will you? Oh, I love you&mdash;I
love you! I love you both, both. But isn&#8217;t
it the twiniest kind of world ever was! Papa
and Uncle Joe are twins; and your mamma
and Red Kimono&#8217;s mamma were twins; and
Tom and Dick are twins; and big Bridget&#8217;s
folks are twins; and&mdash;Oh, oh, there&#8217;s my
darling, red-headed Michael going by! I must
call him in, I truly must! Won&#8217;t he be the
gladdest boy ever lived, to know all about my
new cousins that I never saw coming to live
and play with us in the square? He hasn&#8217;t
any child to his house and you haven&#8217;t any
child but me to yours, Uncle Joe; and the
line-fence is down; so nothing&#8217;s to hinder
Michael and me making another pair of twins,
is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody prevented the child&#8217;s movement to
bring in her first child-friend in that strange
city to which she had come, and presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
entered the jolly lad, flushed and breathless
and a trifle unkempt, as was his habit, but
with such a manly bearing and such a world of
good-fellowship beaming from his freckled
face, that the new Uncle Joe instantly rejoiced
in the prospect of such a comrade for his own
small lads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, Mr. Smith and&mdash;Mr.
Smith; and is it all just as she says?&#8221; demanded
the small gentleman from Virginia. &#8220;Has the
little &#8216;Express Parcel&#8217; really found her right
uncle at last? &#8217;Cause it&#8217;s just like a &#8217;Rabian
Night&#8217;s story, seems to me, and girls&mdash;well,
girls, you know, they&mdash;they&#8217;re sometimes
silly, &#8217;cept Josephine, maybe.&#8221; Then, as if a
sudden fear attacked him he turned upon her,
firmly admonishing her to remember: &#8220;If I&#8217;m
to be your twin, as you say, you&#8217;ve got to
have no nonsense in it. If I say &#8216;go in&#8217; when
there&#8217;s a lot of boys out in the square you&#8217;ll
have to mind, &#8217;cause they don&#8217;t always act
polite, you see. Oh, bother! It&#8217;s all boys,
anyway, isn&#8217;t it! I wish there was another
girl, to even up&#8221;&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;Why, Michael Merriman!&#8221; cried Josephine,
interrupting her playmate&#8217;s long speech.
&#8220;There is another girl! You forget&mdash;how
<i>could</i> you forget&mdash;<i>Penelope!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>At which the new Uncle Joe threw back his
handsome head and laughed as he had not
laughed in many a day; for in fancy he could
see Miss Penelope, aged seven months, helping
&#8220;Cousin Josephine&#8221; to maintain the
dignity of their mutual girlhood, as against a
square full of rollicking lads.</p>

<p>Presently everybody was laughing, for happiness
is delightfully infectious, and always
even more &#8220;catching&#8221; than the measles.
Grandma Merriman and Cousin Desire, who
had come quietly into the room; the three
black &#8220;boys&#8221; in the hall outside; the two
Uncle Joes and Michael; and most heartily,
most musically of all, the little San Diegan,
who for very joy could not keep still, but
went skipping and flying about the room, like
a bewilderingly lovely butterfly, demanding
between whiles of the person nearest:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t it beautiful, beautiful? Aren&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
you glad I was a wrong &#8216;parcel,&#8217; and came to
this wrong, splendid, old Uncle Joe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; answered that gentleman, with
sweet solemnity; &#8220;since your coming has

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
